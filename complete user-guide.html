        <h2>1. Introduction to KABIRU Mining</h2>

        <div class="info-box important">
            <div class="info-box-title">🎯 Our Vision</div>
            <p>To achieve economic independence through the power of Declaration. We are not just mining currency; we are building sovereignty structures for families, communities, and entire generations. KABIRU Mining represents a fundamental shift in how wealth is created, validated, and distributed across the African continent and beyond.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What is KABIRU (iKb)?</h3>
        <p>KABIRU is a revolutionary digital asset that represents real-world value in the TAU Africa Ecosystem. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that require expensive mining equipment costing thousands of dollars and consume massive amounts of electricity, KABIRU uses an innovative system called <strong>Declaration Mining</strong>. This groundbreaking approach allows you to mine digital currency based on the real-world assets and values you declare and have validated through our community-driven verification process.</p>

        <h3>Key Features of KABIRU Mining</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Value-Based Mining:</strong> Your mining capacity is directly proportional to the total value of assets you have declared and had validated in the TAU Africa Main App. This includes land, property, businesses, skills, services, and intellectual property.</li>
            <li><strong>No Hardware Requirements:</strong> Mine directly from your smartphone, tablet, or computer without purchasing specialized equipment. All you need is an internet connection and validated real-world assets.</li>
            <li><strong>Real Economic Value:</strong> 1 iKb equals 100,000 units of local currency (KSH, UGX, TSH, etc.), providing stable, predictable value backed by actual assets in the ecosystem.</li>
            <li><strong>Tiered Mining System:</strong> Three distinct mining levels (Basic, Community, and Sovereign) based on your total declared value, ensuring fair rewards relative to your economic contribution.</li>
            <li><strong>24-Hour Active Cycles:</strong> Daily participation is rewarded through simple button-click activation, making mining accessible to everyone regardless of technical expertise.</li>
            <li><strong>Monthly Cash Withdrawals:</strong> Convert your earned iKb to local currency every 30 days through secure, verified withdrawal processes via mobile money or bank transfer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Who Can Benefit from KABIRU Mining?</h3>
        <p>KABIRU Mining is designed to be inclusive and accessible to a wide range of participants in the TAU Africa Ecosystem. The system recognizes different types of value contributors and rewards them proportionally. Here's how different groups can benefit from Declaration Mining:</p>

        <h4>Landowners and Property Holders</h4>
        <p>If you own land, residential property, commercial buildings, or any real estate, you can declare these assets in the TAU Africa Main App. Once validated by the community and administrators, your property value contributes to your mining capacity. Even small plots of land or modest homes can help you reach the minimum threshold for Level 1 mining (1 million KSH in declared value).</p>

        <h4>Business Owners and Entrepreneurs</h4>
        <p>Operating businesses of any size—from small shops and kiosks to large enterprises—can be declared and validated. Your business assets, inventory, intellectual property, and operational capacity all contribute to your total declared value, potentially qualifying you for higher mining levels and greater daily iKb production.</p>

        <h4>Skilled Professionals and Service Providers</h4>
        <p>Your professional skills, certifications, education, and service capacity have real economic value that can be declared. Teachers, consultants, craftspeople, healthcare workers, IT professionals, and any other skilled individuals can monetize their expertise through the mining system once their skills are validated by the community.</p>

        <h4>Farmers and Agricultural Producers</h4>
        <p>Agricultural land, livestock, farming equipment, and production capacity represent significant value that often goes unrecognized by traditional banking systems. KABIRU Mining allows farmers to leverage their agricultural assets for daily digital currency production.</p>

        <h4>Creative Professionals and Artists</h4>
        <p>Intellectual property, creative works, patents, copyrights, and artistic output can be declared as valuable assets. Musicians, writers, designers, and other creatives can transform their portfolio into mining capacity.</p>

        <h2>2. Declaration Mining Concept</h2>

        <h3>Understanding the Four-Step Process</h3>
        <p>Declaration Mining is built on a transparent, community-driven validation system that ensures every miner's capacity is backed by real, verifiable assets. The process consists of four essential stages that transform your real-world wealth into digital mining power.</p>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">1</span>
            <div class="step-title">Declare Your Values</div>
            <p>In the TAU Africa Main App (accessible at https://magero1985.github.io/Tau-Africa/), you begin by declaring your real-world assets. This comprehensive declaration process captures the full spectrum of your economic value across multiple categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Assets:</strong> Land parcels with title deeds, residential properties (houses, apartments), commercial buildings, vehicles (cars, motorcycles, trucks), agricultural equipment, machinery, and tools. Each physical asset should be documented with relevant proof of ownership.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Assets:</strong> Operating businesses with business registration certificates, inventory and stock, equipment and furniture, intellectual property (patents, trademarks, copyrights), digital assets, and business goodwill. Business declarations should include operational details and revenue information.</li>
                <li><strong>Skills and Services:</strong> Professional skills backed by certifications (medical degrees, engineering licenses, teaching credentials), trade skills (carpentry, plumbing, electrical work), consulting expertise, teaching and training capacity, and specialized knowledge in specific domains. Service capacity declarations should detail your hourly rates and expertise level.</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge Assets:</strong> Educational qualifications, professional experience and track record, specialized expertise in niche areas, research and publications, mentorship capacity, and advisory services. Knowledge declarations help establish your value as a thought leader or consultant.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">2</span>
            <div class="step-title">Three-Stage Validation</div>
            <p>Your declarations undergo rigorous verification through a multi-layered validation process designed to ensure authenticity, accuracy, and community trust. This three-stage system protects the integrity of the entire KABIRU ecosystem:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Internal System Review (Automated):</strong> The TAU system performs initial checks for completeness, consistency, and obvious red flags. This includes verifying that all required fields are filled, documentation is uploaded, declared values fall within reasonable ranges for the asset type, and there are no duplicate declarations in the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecosystem Community Review:</strong> Fellow TAU members who serve as community validators examine your declarations. These validators check for authenticity by reviewing supporting documents, assess whether declared values are realistic based on market rates, verify that assets genuinely exist (through photos, documents, or site visits), and provide feedback or request additional information if needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Administrative Final Approval:</strong> TAU administrators perform the final validation, conducting comprehensive review of all documentation, cross-referencing with external databases where possible, ensuring compliance with TAU policies and local regulations, and making the final determination on value assignment. Once administrators approve, your declared value is locked into your mining capacity.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Validation Timeline:</strong> The complete validation process typically takes 3 to 7 business days from initial declaration to final approval. Simple declarations with clear documentation may be approved faster, while complex declarations involving multiple assets or requiring additional verification may take the full seven days. You will receive email notifications at each stage of the validation process.</p>

            <div class="step-title">Value Bank Activation</div>
            <p>Once your declarations are validated and approved, your total value (calculated in KSH equivalent) is recorded in your Value Bank within the TAU Africa Main App. This Value Bank serves as the foundation for your mining capacity in KABIRU. The system automatically assigns you to one of three mining levels based on your total validated value:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Level 1 - Basic Miner:</strong> For total validated values between 1,000,000 and 5,999,999 KSH. This level allows you to mine 0.005 iKb per day, which equals 500 KSH per day or approximately 15,000 KSH per month with consistent mining.</li>
                <li><strong>Level 2 - Community Miner:</strong> For total validated values between 6,000,000 and 11,999,999 KSH. This level doubles your mining capacity to 0.01 iKb per day, which equals 1,000 KSH per day or approximately 30,000 KSH per month with consistent mining.</li>
                <li><strong>Level 3 - Sovereign Miner:</strong> For total validated values of 12,000,000 KSH and above. This premium level provides the highest mining rate of 0.1 iKb per day, which equals 10,000 KSH per day or approximately 300,000 KSH per month with consistent mining.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your mining level is automatically updated whenever you add and validate additional assets. There is no limit to how high your mining level can grow as you continue to declare and validate more value within the ecosystem.</p>

            <div class="step-title">Begin Mining Operations</div>
            <p>With your Value Bank activated and mining level assigned, you are ready to begin mining KABIRU currency. Login to the KABIRU Mining App at https://magero1985.github.io/Tau-Africa/Kabiru-Mining-Portal/ and click the prominent <strong>MINE</strong> button to start your first 24-hour mining cycle. Your iKb accumulates automatically over the next 24 hours based on your mining level, with earnings distributed evenly across the cycle (hourly accumulation). You must return within 24 hours to click the MINE button again to start your next cycle—this active participation requirement ensures miners remain engaged with the ecosystem.</p>

        <div class="info-box tip">
            <div class="info-box-title">💡 Why This System Creates Real Value</div>
            <p>Declaration Mining succeeds where many cryptocurrency systems fail because it is backed by real, tangible value rather than speculation. Consider these fundamental principles that make KABIRU sustainable:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Asset-Backed Currency:</strong> Your mining capacity is directly proportional to verified real-world assets. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, where mining creates value from computational work, KABIRU mining distributes value based on what you already own. This means every iKb mined represents a fraction of the total asset pool in the TAU ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Validation Builds Trust:</strong> The three-stage validation process creates multiple layers of verification. Community validators who live in your region can verify the existence of land or businesses. Administrators cross-reference official records. This distributed validation system makes fraud extremely difficult and builds confidence across the entire network.</li>
                <li><strong>Stable Value Maintenance:</strong> The 1 iKb = 100,000 KSH exchange rate is maintained through careful ecosystem management. The total amount of iKb that can be mined is proportional to the total validated asset pool. As more assets are declared and validated, more mining capacity becomes available, but always in proportion to real value added to the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Controlled Withdrawals:</strong> Monthly withdrawal limits and processing periods allow the TAU Foundation to manage liquidity without compromising the stability of iKb value. This prevents bank-run scenarios that have collapsed other digital currency projects.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Incentive Alignment:</strong> Miners are incentivized to declare honest values because over-declaration leads to rejection during validation, wasting time. Under-declaration leaves mining capacity on the table. The system naturally encourages accurate declarations that reflect true market value.</li>

        <h2>3. Getting Started & Login</h2>

        <h3>Prerequisites for KABIRU Mining</h3>
        <p>Before you can begin mining operations in KABIRU, you must complete several essential prerequisites within the TAU Africa ecosystem. These requirements ensure that every miner has legitimate, validated assets backing their mining capacity and maintains the integrity of the entire system.</p>

        <div class="info-box important">
            <div class="info-box-title">✅ Essential Requirements Checklist</div>
            <p>You MUST complete ALL of the following steps before you can start mining KABIRU currency:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Submit Declarations in TAU Africa Main App:</strong> Log into https://magero1985.github.io/Tau-Africa/ and add these new asset declarations through the value declaration interface. Be thorough and accurate in your descriptions—overvaluation will be caught during validation and may delay approval, while undervaluation leaves mining capacity on the table.</li>
                <li><strong>Complete Validation Process:</strong> Your new declarations will go through the same three-stage validation (Internal Review, Community Validation, Administrative Approval) that took three to seven business days for your initial declarations. Monitor your email for validation updates and respond promptly to any requests for additional information or clarification from validators.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic Level Upgrade:</strong> Once your new declarations are validated and approved, your total validated value in TAU Africa automatically updates. The KABIRU Mining system continuously synchronizes with your TAU Africa Value Bank. The moment your total crosses into a new tier—for example, when you reach 6,000,000 KSH total value moving from Level 1 to Level 2, or 12,000,000 KSH moving to Level 3—your mining level upgrades automatically. You don't need to take any manual action in KABIRU Mining.</li>
                <li><strong>Immediate Rate Adjustment:</strong> Your new, higher mining rate takes effect with your very next mining cycle. If you're mid-cycle when the upgrade happens, you'll finish that cycle at your old rate, but clicking MINE again will start a cycle at your new, upgraded rate. You'll receive an email notification confirming your level upgrade and new daily production rate.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Practical Example of Upgrade Process:</strong> Sarah is currently a Level 1 miner with 4,000,000 KSH in validated assets (land worth 2,500,000 KSH and skills worth 1,500,000 KSH). She realizes she owns a vehicle worth 1,800,000 KSH and business equipment worth 1,200,000 KSH that she hasn't declared. She prepares photos and receipts for these assets and submits declarations in TAU Africa. After five days, her new declarations are validated. Her total value is now 7,000,000 KSH (4M + 1.8M + 1.2M), automatically upgrading her to Level 2. Her daily mining rate instantly doubles from 0.005 iKb to 0.01 iKb, doubling her earning potential from 15,000 KSH per month to 30,000 KSH per month.</p>

        <h2>5. Understanding Mining Levels</h2>

        <h3>The Three-Tier System Explained</h3>
        <p>KABIRU Mining employs a three-tier structure that directly correlates your mining capacity with your economic contribution to the TAU ecosystem. This tiered approach ensures fairness by rewarding members proportionally to their validated real-world assets while maintaining accessibility for members at all economic levels. The system recognizes that value comes in many forms—from the small landowner with a modest plot to the large business owner with extensive operations—and provides appropriate mining capacity for each.</p>

        </table>

        <p><strong>Who This Level Serves:</strong> Level 1 is designed for new members joining the TAU ecosystem, individuals with modest asset portfolios focused primarily on skills or small property holdings, young professionals building their wealth, and members in the process of declaring and validating additional assets. This entry-level mining rate ensures that everyone with minimum qualifying assets can participate in the KABIRU economy and benefit from declaration mining, regardless of their current economic position.</p>

        <p><strong>Real-World Applications of Level 1 Earnings:</strong> A monthly income of 15,000 KSH from Level 1 mining can cover significant household expenses in many African contexts. This amount can pay for children's school fees at primary level, contribute substantially to monthly food budgets for small families, cover transportation costs for commuting to work, provide emergency savings buffer, or fund small business inventory purchases. For many Level 1 miners, these earnings represent meaningful supplementary income that improves quality of life and provides financial flexibility.</p>

        <p><strong>Who This Level Serves:</strong> Level 2 miners typically include established professionals with property ownership, small to medium business owners with operational enterprises, property owners with residential or commercial real estate, individuals who have successfully combined multiple asset categories (land + business + skills), and members who have deliberately declared and validated diverse asset portfolios to reach this tier.</p>

        <p><strong>Economic Impact of Level 2 Earnings:</strong> Monthly earnings of 30,000 KSH represent significant additional income in most African economies. This amount can cover rent payments for family housing in urban areas, pay for secondary school fees for multiple children, fund small business expansion or inventory investment, provide savings for major household purchases (furniture, appliances), cover healthcare costs including insurance premiums, or contribute substantially to home loan payments. For many Level 2 miners, these earnings represent the difference between financial stability and financial stress.</p>

        <p><strong>Who This Level Serves:</strong> Level 3 miners represent the highest tier of the KABIRU ecosystem and typically include large landowners with multiple properties or extensive acreage, established business owners with significant operations and assets, professionals with substantial real estate and investment portfolios, individuals who have built comprehensive asset declarations across multiple categories, and family estates or multi-generational wealth that has been properly declared and validated.</p>

        <p><strong>Transformative Potential of Level 3 Earnings:</strong> Monthly earnings of 300,000 KSH from Level 3 mining represent substantial income by any standard. This amount exceeds average middle-class salaries in many African countries and can fund university education for multiple children, make significant real estate investments or down payments, support business expansion including hiring employees, provide comprehensive healthcare including private insurance, build long-term investment portfolios, or support multiple family members across generations. Annual earnings of 3,650,000 KSH create genuine wealth-building opportunities and can transform the economic trajectory of families and communities.</p>

                <li><strong>Compounding Value of Upgrades:</strong> Upgrading from Level 1 to Level 2 doubles your daily earnings, while upgrading from Level 2 to Level 3 increases earnings tenfold compared to Level 1. The difference between levels becomes more dramatic over time—a five-year Level 3 miner earns twenty times what a five-year Level 1 miner earns. This creates strong incentive to declare all possible assets and reach higher mining tiers.</li>
                <li><strong>Investment in Asset Declaration:</strong> The time and effort required to document and declare additional assets pays significant dividends through higher mining rates. Even if declaring new assets requires spending money on documentation, valuations, or certifications, the increased mining income typically recoups these costs within months through higher daily production.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-Term Wealth Building:</strong> KABIRU Mining is designed as a long-term wealth-building mechanism rather than a get-rich-quick scheme. Level 3 miners who consistently mine for five years can accumulate over 18 million KSH worth of iKb, representing transformative wealth that can fund major life goals, business investments, or multi-generational asset building.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility at All Levels:</strong> Even Level 1 mining provides meaningful value—182,500 KSH per year represents significant additional income in most African contexts. The system ensures that members at all economic levels can participate and benefit, while still providing proportionally greater rewards to those who contribute more validated value to the ecosystem.</li>

                <li><strong>TAU Member ID Login:</strong> Use your unique Member ID (TSK-XXXXXX-XXX or TLK-XXXXXX-XXX format). This method is faster for users who have memorized their Member ID and prefer not to type their email address repeatedly. Your Member ID serves as a universal identifier across all TAU ecosystem applications.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Select your preferred method from the dropdown menu or radio buttons provided on the login screen. The system will validate either credential against your TAU Africa account records to authenticate your identity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">3</span>
            <div class="step-title">Enter Your Credentials</div>
            <p>Carefully type your chosen identifier (email address or Member ID) in the appropriate field. Then enter your TAU Africa account password in the password field. The password field masks your input with asterisks or dots for security purposes—you can usually click an "eye" icon to temporarily reveal your password if needed to verify correct entry.</p>
            <p><strong>Important Security Notes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Passwords are case-sensitive—ensure your Caps Lock key is not accidentally engaged</li>
                <li>Check for extra spaces before or after your email address or Member ID</li>
                <li>If copy-pasting credentials, ensure no hidden characters are included</li>
                <li>Never share your password with anyone, including people claiming to be TAU support staff</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">4</span>
            <div class="step-title">Link TAU Member ID (First Time Only)</div>
            <p>On your very first login to KABIRU Mining, the system will detect that your Member ID has not yet been linked to a mining account. You will be prompted to complete a one-time linking process that connects your validated Value Bank from TAU Africa Main App to your KABIRU Mining operations.</p>
            <p>During this linking process, the system performs several critical operations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Verifies that the Member ID you enter matches your authenticated account</li>
                <li>Retrieves your total validated asset value from the TAU Africa database</li>
                <li>Calculates and assigns your appropriate mining level based on your total declared value</li>
                <li>Establishes the data synchronization pathway between TAU Africa and KABIRU Mining</li>
                <li>Creates your KABIRU wallet and initializes your mining dashboard</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why This Linking is Critical:</strong> Without a properly linked Member ID, the KABIRU system has no way to determine your mining capacity. Your mining level is calculated based on your validated assets in TAU Africa, so this connection is absolutely essential. The linking process typically completes within seconds, and you only need to do this once—all subsequent logins will automatically recognize your linked account.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">5</span>
            <div class="step-title">Email Verification (If Required)</div>
            <p>If you registered for KABIRU Mining with an email address that differs from your TAU Africa Main App email, you may be required to verify this email address before mining operations can begin. This security measure prevents unauthorized account creation and ensures that all communication about your mining activities reaches you reliably.</p>
            <p>Check your email inbox for a verification message from TAU Africa. The subject line will typically be "KABIRU Mining - Verify Your Email Address" or similar. Open this email and click the verification link provided. If you don't see the email within five minutes, check your spam or junk mail folder—sometimes automated emails are incorrectly filtered by email providers.</p>
            <p>Once you click the verification link, your browser will open a confirmation page indicating successful email verification. You can then return to the KABIRU Mining Portal and complete your login process. This verification is a one-time requirement that ensures the security and deliverability of all future communications regarding your mining operations, withdrawal notifications, and system updates.</p>

        <h2>4. Linking Your TAU Member ID</h2>

        <h3>The Importance of Member ID Linking</h3>
        <p>Your TAU Member ID serves as the critical bridge that connects your validated real-world assets (declared and verified in TAU Africa Main App) with your digital mining operations in KABIRU Mining. This unique identifier, formatted as either TSK-XXXXXX-XXX for TAU-Skill members or TLK-XXXXXX-XXX for TAU-Land members, is not merely a login credential—it is the fundamental mechanism through which the KABIRU system accesses and verifies your mining eligibility.</p>

        <p>The Member ID linking process establishes a secure, authenticated data pathway between the two applications that allows KABIRU Mining to continuously reference your validated asset total, automatically update your mining level when you add new validated assets, synchronize your earning history across the ecosystem, and verify your identity for withdrawal requests and other sensitive operations.</p>

        <p><strong>Without a properly linked Member ID, you CANNOT mine KABIRU currency.</strong> The system has no way to determine your mining capacity, assign your appropriate level, or authorize your daily mining operations. This security measure ensures that only legitimate members with verified assets can participate in the mining ecosystem.</p>

        <h3>Understanding What Linking Accomplishes</h3>
        <p>When you link your TAU Member ID to your KABIRU Mining account, the system performs a series of critical operations that prepare your account for mining operations:</p>

        <h4>1. Asset Value Retrieval</h4>
        <p>The KABIRU system queries the TAU Africa database using your Member ID to retrieve your complete Value Bank information. This includes the total sum of all your validated asset declarations across all categories (physical property, business assets, skills, knowledge). The system calculates this total in real-time to ensure it reflects your most current validated value, accounting for any recent additions or updates you may have made.</p>

        <h4>2. Mining Level Assignment</h4>
        <p>Based on your total validated value, KABIRU automatically assigns you to the appropriate mining level according to these thresholds:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Your Total Validated Value</th>
                <th>Assigned Mining Level</th>
                <th>Daily Mining Rate</th>
                <th>Monthly Potential Earnings</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1,000,000 - 5,999,999 KSH</td>
                <td>Level 1 (Basic Miner)</td>
                <td>0.005 iKb per day</td>
                <td>~0.15 iKb (15,000 KSH)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>6,000,000 - 11,999,999 KSH</td>
                <td>Level 2 (Community Miner)</td>
                <td>0.01 iKb per day</td>
                <td>~0.30 iKb (30,000 KSH)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>12,000,000+ KSH</td>
                <td>Level 3 (Sovereign Miner)</td>
                <td>0.1 iKb per day</td>
                <td>~3.0 iKb (300,000 KSH)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>This assignment happens automatically and instantaneously during the linking process. Your mining level is not fixed—it will automatically upgrade when your total validated value crosses into a higher tier as you declare and validate additional assets over time.</p>

        <h4>3. Wallet Initialization</h4>
        <p>The linking process creates your KABIRU wallet, a secure digital repository where all your mined iKb currency is stored. This wallet is uniquely associated with your Member ID and cannot be accessed by anyone else. The wallet includes multiple features including current balance tracking, transaction history logging, withdrawal request capabilities, and integration with other TAU ecosystem applications for seamless point transfers.</p>

        <h4>4. Dashboard Configuration</h4>
        <p>Your personalized mining dashboard is configured with your specific parameters, including your mining level, daily production rate, total validated asset value, mining history, referral tracking, and current wallet balance. This dashboard serves as your command center for all KABIRU Mining operations.</p>

        <h3>Step-by-Step Linking Process</h3>
        <p>The Member ID linking process is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly, requiring only a few minutes to complete. Follow these detailed instructions for successful linking:</p>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">1</span>
            <div class="step-title">Access Profile Settings or Linking Interface</div>
            <p>After completing your initial login to KABIRU Mining (using your TAU Africa email and password), the system will automatically detect that your Member ID has not yet been linked. You will be presented with a linking interface—this may appear as a popup modal, a dedicated linking page, or within your profile settings section. The interface will be clearly labeled "Link TAU Member ID" or "Connect Your TAU Account" with instructions guiding you through the process.</p>
            <p>If you have already logged in but did not complete the linking process, you can access it manually by clicking on your profile icon or avatar in the top right corner of the screen, selecting "Settings" or "Profile Settings" from the dropdown menu, and navigating to the "Account Linking" or "TAU Member ID" section.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">2</span>
            <div class="step-title">Enter Your Complete Member ID</div>
            <p>Locate your TAU Member ID from your TAU Africa Main App account or from the welcome email you received when you registered. The Member ID follows a specific format that must be entered exactly as shown, including all hyphens and maintaining the correct letter case:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>TAU-Skill Format:</strong> <span class="code">TSK-XXXXXX-XXX</span> where XXXXXX is your unique six-digit member number and XXX is your three-digit verification code</li>
                <li><strong>TAU-Land Format:</strong> <span class="code">TLK-XXXXXX-XXX</span> with the same structure as above but with TLK prefix indicating TAU-Land membership</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Type your complete Member ID carefully into the provided input field. The system may provide real-time format validation, indicating with a green checkmark when the format is correct or a red X when it detects formatting errors. Double-check that you have included the correct prefix (TSK or TLK), all hyphens in the right positions, and all digits entered correctly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">3</span>
            <div class="step-title">Verification and Confirmation</div>
            <p>Once you have entered your Member ID, click the "Link Account" or "Verify Member ID" button. The KABIRU system will immediately begin the verification process, which typically completes within five to fifteen seconds. During this time, the system performs several security and validation checks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Member ID Existence Check:</strong> Verifies that the Member ID you entered actually exists in the TAU Africa database and is associated with an active account</li>
                <li><strong>Email Match Verification:</strong> Confirms that the email address you used to log into KABIRU Mining matches the email address registered with this Member ID in TAU Africa, preventing unauthorized account linking</li>
                <li><strong>Validation Status Check:</strong> Ensures that your TAU Africa account has completed asset declarations with approved validation status (minimum 1,000,000 KSH in validated value)</li>
                <li><strong>Duplicate Prevention:</strong> Checks that this Member ID has not already been linked to a different KABIRU Mining account, maintaining one-to-one account relationships</li>
                <li><strong>Data Synchronization:</strong> If all checks pass, the system pulls your complete validated value information from TAU Africa and calculates your appropriate mining level</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You will see a progress indicator or loading animation during this verification process. Do not close your browser or navigate away from the page until the process completes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">4</span>
            <div class="step-title">Review Confirmation Details</div>
            <p>Upon successful linking, the system will display a comprehensive confirmation screen showing all the details that have been established for your mining account. Review this information carefully to ensure accuracy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linked Member ID:</strong> Displays your complete Member ID that is now permanently associated with this KABIRU Mining account</li>
                <li><strong>Total Validated Value:</strong> Shows the exact total of your validated assets pulled from TAU Africa, displayed in KSH with proper formatting (e.g., "4,500,000 KSH" or "15,750,000 KSH")</li>

            <div class="info-box-title">💰 Understanding Your Mining Level Assignment</div>
            <p>Your mining level directly determines your earning potential within KABIRU Mining. Understanding how the system calculates and assigns levels helps you make informed decisions about declaring additional assets to potentially upgrade your mining capacity. Here's a detailed breakdown of the three mining levels with comprehensive examples:</p>
            
            <h4>Level 1 - Basic Miner (1M - 5.99M KSH)</h4>
            <p><strong>Profile Example:</strong> John owns a small plot of land worth 2,500,000 KSH and has professional skills as a teacher valued at 1,500,000 KSH. His total validated value is 4,000,000 KSH, placing him solidly in Level 1.</p>
            <p><strong>Mining Capacity:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Daily Production: 0.005 iKb = 500 KSH per day</li>
                <li>Weekly Production: 0.035 iKb = 3,500 KSH per week</li>
                <li>Monthly Production: ~0.15 iKb = 15,000 KSH per month</li>
                <li>Annual Production: ~1.825 iKb = 182,500 KSH per year</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Level 1 is ideal for new members, those with modest asset portfolios, or individuals primarily relying on skill declarations. While the daily rate may seem small, consistent mining over months and years can accumulate significant value, especially as you declare additional assets to increase your mining level.</p>

            <h4>Level 2 - Community Miner (6M - 11.99M KSH)</h4>
            <p><strong>Profile Example:</strong> Mary owns a residential property worth 5,000,000 KSH, runs a small business valued at 3,000,000 KSH, and has certified professional skills worth 1,500,000 KSH. Her total validated value is 9,500,000 KSH, qualifying her for Level 2.</p>
            <p><strong>Mining Capacity:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Daily Production: 0.01 iKb = 1,000 KSH per day</li>
                <li>Weekly Production: 0.07 iKb = 7,000 KSH per week</li>
                <li>Monthly Production: ~0.30 iKb = 30,000 KSH per month</li>
                <li>Annual Production: ~3.65 iKb = 365,000 KSH per year</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Level 2 represents established members with moderate asset portfolios. This level doubles the mining rate of Level 1, making it a significant upgrade. Many small business owners, property owners, and professionals with multiple income streams operate at this level.</p>

            <h4>Level 3 - Sovereign Miner (12M+ KSH)</h4>
            <p><strong>Profile Example:</strong> David owns commercial property worth 8,000,000 KSH, agricultural land valued at 6,000,000 KSH, operates a medium-sized business worth 4,000,000 KSH, and has specialized professional expertise valued at 2,000,000 KSH. His total validated value is 20,000,000 KSH, placing him in Level 3.</p>
            <p><strong>Mining Capacity:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Daily Production: 0.1 iKb = 10,000 KSH per day</li>
                <li>Weekly Production: 0.7 iKb = 70,000 KSH per week</li>
                <li>Monthly Production: ~3.0 iKb = 300,000 KSH per month</li>
                <li>Annual Production: ~36.5 iKb = 3,650,000 KSH per year</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Level 3 represents high-value members with substantial asset portfolios. This premium level provides ten times the mining rate of Level 1 and five times that of Level 2. Large landowners, established business owners, and professionals with extensive asset portfolios typically operate at this level. The earning potential at Level 3 can represent a significant secondary income stream or even primary income for dedicated miners.</p>

        <h3>How to Upgrade Your Mining Level</h3>
        <p>Your mining level is not permanent—it automatically adjusts based on your total validated value in TAU Africa. To upgrade your mining level and increase your daily production rate, follow this strategic process:</p>

        <div class="info-box tip">
            <div class="info-box-title">📈 Mining Level Upgrade Strategy</div>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identify Additional Assets to Declare:</strong> Review your complete asset portfolio to identify valuable items or capabilities you haven't yet declared in TAU Africa Main App. Consider property you may have inherited, vehicles you own, business assets, equipment, professional certifications you've obtained, or specialized skills you possess. Even if you initially focused on declaring land, remember that TAU Africa values all types of assets including intellectual property, business goodwill, and service capacity.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare Documentation:</strong> Gather supporting documents for these new declarations including title deeds or land certificates for property, business registration documents for enterprises, receipts or valuation reports for vehicles and equipment, professional certificates and licenses for skills, photos and descriptions of business inventory, and any other proof of ownership or capability. Quality documentation speeds up the validation process and increases approval likelihood.</li>

        <h2>3. Getting Started & Login</h2>

        <h3>Prerequisites for KABIRU Mining</h3>
        <p>Before you can begin mining operations in KABIRU, you must complete several essential prerequisites within the TAU Africa ecosystem. These requirements ensure that every miner has legitimate, validated assets backing their mining capacity and maintains the integrity of the entire system.</p>

        <div class="info-box important">
            <div class="info-box-title">✅ Essential Requirements Checklist</div>
            <p>You MUST complete ALL of the following steps before you can start mining KABIRU currency:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>TAU Africa Registration:</strong> Register for a TAU Africa account at https://magero1985.github.io/Tau-Africa/ and receive your unique Member ID (either TSK-XXXXXX-XXX for TAU-Skill members or TLK-XXXXXX-XXX for TAU-Land members). This Member ID serves as your primary identifier across the entire TAU ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Value Declaration:</strong> Declare at least 1,000,000 KSH worth of assets in the TAU Africa Main App. This minimum threshold qualifies you for Level 1 mining status. Your declarations can include any combination of land, property, businesses, vehicles, skills, or other verifiable assets.</li>
                <li><strong>Validation Approval:</strong> Wait for your declared values to complete the three-stage validation process (Internal Review, Community Validation, and Administrative Approval). This typically takes between three to seven business days depending on the complexity of your declarations and the completeness of your documentation.</li>
                <li><strong>Login Credentials:</strong> Have your TAU Africa registered email address and password ready. You will use these same credentials to access KABIRU Mining, maintaining a unified authentication system across all TAU applications.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h3>Accessing the KABIRU Mining Portal</h3>
        <p>The KABIRU Mining application is a web-based platform accessible from any device with internet connectivity. Unlike traditional mining operations that require specialized hardware and software installation, KABIRU Mining runs entirely through your web browser, making it universally accessible regardless of your device type or operating system.</p>

        <p><strong>Official Web Address:</strong> <span class="code">https://magero1985.github.io/Tau-Africa/Kabiru-Mining-Portal/</span></p>

        <p>This URL should be bookmarked in your browser or added to your mobile device's home screen for quick, convenient access. The portal is optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing, automatically adjusting its layout to provide the best user experience on screens of all sizes.</p>

        <h3>First-Time Login Procedure</h3>
        <p>Your initial login to KABIRU Mining establishes the connection between your TAU Africa account (with its validated assets) and your mining operations. Follow these detailed steps carefully to ensure successful setup:</p>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">1</span>
            <div class="step-title">Navigate to KABIRU Mining Portal</div>
            <p>Open your preferred web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge) and navigate to the KABIRU Mining Portal URL provided above. The page will load with the TAU Africa branding and the KABIRU Mining login interface. Ensure you are accessing the official URL to protect your account security—never enter your credentials on suspicious or unofficial websites.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">2</span>
            <div class="step-title">Select Your Login Method</div>
            <p>KABIRU Mining offers two convenient authentication methods to accommodate different user preferences. Choose the method that works best for you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Email Login:</strong> Use the email address you registered with in TAU Africa Main App. This is the recommended method for most users as it provides a familiar authentication experience consistent with other web services you may use daily.</li>
                <li><strong>TAU Member ID Login:</strong> Use your unique Member ID (TSK-XXXXXX-XXX or TLK-XXXXXX-XXX format). This method is faster for users who have memorized their Member ID and prefer not to type their email address repeatedly. Your Member ID serves as a universal identifier across all TAU ecosystem applications.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Select your preferred method from the dropdown menu or radio buttons provided on the login screen. The system will validate either credential against your TAU Africa account records to authenticate your identity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">3</span>
            <div class="step-title">Enter Your Credentials</div>
            <p>Carefully type your chosen identifier (email address or Member ID) in the appropriate field. Then enter your TAU Africa account password in the password field. The password field masks your input with asterisks or dots for security purposes—you can usually click an "eye" icon to temporarily reveal your password if needed to verify correct entry.</p>
            <p><strong>Important Security Notes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Passwords are case-sensitive—ensure your Caps Lock key is not accidentally engaged</li>
                <li>Check for extra spaces before or after your email address or Member ID</li>
                <li>If copy-pasting credentials, ensure no hidden characters are included</li>
                <li>Never share your password with anyone, including people claiming to be TAU support staff</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">4</span>
            <div class="step-title">Link TAU Member ID (First Time Only)</div>
            <p>On your very first login to KABIRU Mining, the system will detect that your Member ID has not yet been linked to a mining account. You will be prompted to complete a one-time linking process that connects your validated Value Bank from TAU Africa Main App to your KABIRU Mining operations.</p>
            <p>During this linking process, the system performs several critical operations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Verifies that the Member ID you enter matches your authenticated account</li>
                <li>Retrieves your total validated asset value from the TAU Africa database</li>
                <li>Calculates and assigns your appropriate mining level based on your total declared value</li>
                <li>Establishes the data synchronization pathway between TAU Africa and KABIRU Mining</li>
                <li>Creates your KABIRU wallet and initializes your mining dashboard</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why This Linking is Critical:</strong> Without a properly linked Member ID, the KABIRU system has no way to determine your mining capacity. Your mining level is calculated based on your validated assets in TAU Africa, so this connection is absolutely essential. The linking process typically completes within seconds, and you only need to do this once—all subsequent logins will automatically recognize your linked account.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">5</span>
            <div class="step-title">Email Verification (If Required)</div>
            <p>If you registered for KABIRU Mining with an email address that differs from your TAU Africa Main App email, you may be required to verify this email address before mining operations can begin. This security measure prevents unauthorized account creation and ensures that all communication about your mining activities reaches you reliably.</p>
            <p>Check your email inbox for a verification message from TAU Africa. The subject line will typically be "KABIRU Mining - Verify Your Email Address" or similar. Open this email and click the verification link provided. If you don't see the email within five minutes, check your spam or junk mail folder—sometimes automated emails are incorrectly filtered by email providers.</p>
            <p>Once you click the verification link, your browser will open a confirmation page indicating successful email verification. You can then return to the KABIRU Mining Portal and complete your login process. This verification is a one-time requirement that ensures the security and deliverability of all future communications regarding your mining operations, withdrawal notifications, and system updates.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-box warning">
            <div class="info-box-title">⚠️ Common Login Issues and Solutions</div>
            <p>If you encounter difficulties logging into KABIRU Mining, review these common problems and their solutions before contacting support:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wrong Password Error:</strong> Use the "Forgot Password" link to initiate a password reset process. A reset link will be sent to your registered email address. Follow the instructions in that email to create a new password. Remember that passwords are case-sensitive and must match exactly.</li>
                <li><strong>Email Not Verified:</strong> Check your email inbox (and spam/junk folders) for the verification email. Click the verification link. If you cannot find the email, use the "Resend Verification Email" option on the login screen to receive a new verification message.</li>
                <li><strong>No Member ID:</strong> You must first complete the registration process in TAU Africa Main App at https://magero1985.github.io/Tau-Africa/ to receive your Member ID. KABIRU Mining cannot be accessed without a TAU Africa account as your mining capacity depends on validated assets declared in that system.</li>
                <li><strong>No Validated Values:</strong> Your TAU Africa account must contain at least 1,000,000 KSH worth of validated assets before you can begin mining. If you have declared assets but they are still pending validation, you must wait for the validation process to complete (typically three to seven business days). Log back into TAU Africa Main App to check your validation status.</li>
                <li><strong>Browser Compatibility:</strong> KABIRU Mining works best with modern web browsers including Google Chrome (version 80+), Mozilla Firefox (version 75+), Safari (version 13+), or Microsoft Edge (version 80+). If you experience technical issues, try updating your browser to the latest version or switching to a different browser.</li>

        <h2>4. Linking Your TAU Member ID</h2>

        <h3>The Importance of Member ID Linking</h3>
        <p>Your TAU Member ID serves as the critical bridge that connects your validated real-world assets (declared and verified in TAU Africa Main App) with your digital mining operations in KABIRU Mining. This unique identifier, formatted as either TSK-XXXXXX-XXX for TAU-Skill members or TLK-XXXXXX-XXX for TAU-Land members, is not merely a login credential—it is the fundamental mechanism through which the KABIRU system accesses and verifies your mining eligibility.</p>

        <p>The Member ID linking process establishes a secure, authenticated data pathway between the two applications that allows KABIRU Mining to continuously reference your validated asset total, automatically update your mining level when you add new validated assets, synchronize your earning history across the ecosystem, and verify your identity for withdrawal requests and other sensitive operations.</p>

        <p><strong>Without a properly linked Member ID, you CANNOT mine KABIRU currency.</strong> The system has no way to determine your mining capacity, assign your appropriate level, or authorize your daily mining operations. This security measure ensures that only legitimate members with verified assets can participate in the mining ecosystem.</p>

        <h3>Understanding What Linking Accomplishes</h3>
        <p>When you link your TAU Member ID to your KABIRU Mining account, the system performs a series of critical operations that prepare your account for mining operations:</p>

        <h4>1. Asset Value Retrieval</h4>
        <p>The KABIRU system queries the TAU Africa database using your Member ID to retrieve your complete Value Bank information. This includes the total sum of all your validated asset declarations across all categories (physical property, business assets, skills, knowledge). The system calculates this total in real-time to ensure it reflects your most current validated value, accounting for any recent additions or updates you may have made.</p>

        <h4>2. Mining Level Assignment</h4>
        <p>Based on your total validated value, KABIRU automatically assigns you to the appropriate mining level according to these thresholds:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Your Total Validated Value</th>
                <th>Assigned Mining Level</th>
                <th>Daily Mining Rate</th>
                <th>Monthly Potential Earnings</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1,000,000 - 5,999,999 KSH</td>
                <td>Level 1 (Basic Miner)</td>
                <td>0.005 iKb per day</td>
                <td>~0.15 iKb (15,000 KSH)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>6,000,000 - 11,999,999 KSH</td>
                <td>Level 2 (Community Miner)</td>
                <td>0.01 iKb per day</td>
                <td>~0.30 iKb (30,000 KSH)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>12,000,000+ KSH</td>
                <td>Level 3 (Sovereign Miner)</td>
                <td>0.1 iKb per day</td>
                <td>~3.0 iKb (300,000 KSH)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>This assignment happens automatically and instantaneously during the linking process. Your mining level is not fixed—it will automatically upgrade when your total validated value crosses into a higher tier as you declare and validate additional assets over time.</p>

        <h4>3. Wallet Initialization</h4>
        <p>The linking process creates your KABIRU wallet, a secure digital repository where all your mined iKb currency is stored. This wallet is uniquely associated with your Member ID and cannot be accessed by anyone else. The wallet includes multiple features including current balance tracking, transaction history logging, withdrawal request capabilities, and integration with other TAU ecosystem applications for seamless point transfers.</p>

        <h4>4. Dashboard Configuration</h4>
        <p>Your personalized mining dashboard is configured with your specific parameters, including your mining level, daily production rate, total validated asset value, mining history, referral tracking, and current wallet balance. This dashboard serves as your command center for all KABIRU Mining operations.</p>

        <h3>Step-by-Step Linking Process</h3>
        <p>The Member ID linking process is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly, requiring only a few minutes to complete. Follow these detailed instructions for successful linking:</p>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">1</span>
            <div class="step-title">Access Profile Settings or Linking Interface</div>
            <p>After completing your initial login to KABIRU Mining (using your TAU Africa email and password), the system will automatically detect that your Member ID has not yet been linked. You will be presented with a linking interface—this may appear as a popup modal, a dedicated linking page, or within your profile settings section. The interface will be clearly labeled "Link TAU Member ID" or "Connect Your TAU Account" with instructions guiding you through the process.</p>
            <p>If you have already logged in but did not complete the linking process, you can access it manually by clicking on your profile icon or avatar in the top right corner of the screen, selecting "Settings" or "Profile Settings" from the dropdown menu, and navigating to the "Account Linking" or "TAU Member ID" section.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">2</span>
            <div class="step-title">Enter Your Complete Member ID</div>
            <p>Locate your TAU Member ID from your TAU Africa Main App account or from the welcome email you received when you registered. The Member ID follows a specific format that must be entered exactly as shown, including all hyphens and maintaining the correct letter case:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>TAU-Skill Format:</strong> <span class="code">TSK-XXXXXX-XXX</span> where XXXXXX is your unique six-digit member number and XXX is your three-digit verification code</li>
                <li><strong>TAU-Land Format:</strong> <span class="code">TLK-XXXXXX-XXX</span> with the same structure as above but with TLK prefix indicating TAU-Land membership</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Type your complete Member ID carefully into the provided input field. The system may provide real-time format validation, indicating with a green checkmark when the format is correct or a red X when it detects formatting errors. Double-check that you have included the correct prefix (TSK or TLK), all hyphens in the right positions, and all digits entered correctly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">3</span>
            <div class="step-title">Verification and Confirmation</div>
            <p>Once you have entered your Member ID, click the "Link Account" or "Verify Member ID" button. The KABIRU system will immediately begin the verification process, which typically completes within five to fifteen seconds. During this time, the system performs several security and validation checks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Member ID Existence Check:</strong> Verifies that the Member ID you entered actually exists in the TAU Africa database and is associated with an active account</li>
                <li><strong>Email Match Verification:</strong> Confirms that the email address you used to log into KABIRU Mining matches the email address registered with this Member ID in TAU Africa, preventing unauthorized account linking</li>
                <li><strong>Validation Status Check:</strong> Ensures that your TAU Africa account has completed asset declarations with approved validation status (minimum 1,000,000 KSH in validated value)</li>
                <li><strong>Duplicate Prevention:</strong> Checks that this Member ID has not already been linked to a different KABIRU Mining account, maintaining one-to-one account relationships</li>
                <li><strong>Data Synchronization:</strong> If all checks pass, the system pulls your complete validated value information from TAU Africa and calculates your appropriate mining level</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You will see a progress indicator or loading animation during this verification process. Do not close your browser or navigate away from the page until the process completes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">4</span>
            <div class="step-title">Review Confirmation Details</div>
            <p>Upon successful linking, the system will display a comprehensive confirmation screen showing all the details that have been established for your mining account. Review this information carefully to ensure accuracy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linked Member ID:</strong> Displays your complete Member ID that is now permanently associated with this KABIRU Mining account</li>
                <li><strong>Total Validated Value:</strong> Shows the exact total of your validated assets pulled from TAU Africa, displayed in KSH with proper formatting (e.g., "4,500,000 KSH" or "15,750,000 KSH")</li>
                <li><strong>Assigned Mining Level:</strong> Clearly indicates whether you are Level 1 (Basic), Level 2 (Community), or Level 3 (Sovereign) based on your validated value</li>
                <li><strong>Daily Mining Rate:</strong> Specifies exactly how much iKb you will produce each day (0.005 iKb, 0.01 iKb, or 0.1 iKb depending on your level)</li>
                <li><strong>Hourly Accumulation:</strong> Shows your hourly earning rate, calculated by dividing your daily rate by 24 hours, helping you understand how your earnings accumulate throughout each mining cycle</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If any information appears incorrect—for example, if your validated value is lower than expected—return to TAU Africa Main App to verify that all your asset declarations have been properly validated. Contact TAU support if you believe there is an error in the system's calculation or data retrieval.</p>

            <div class="info-box-title">💰 Understanding Your Mining Level Assignment</div>
            <p>Your mining level directly determines your earning potential within KABIRU Mining. Understanding how the system calculates and assigns levels helps you make informed decisions about declaring additional assets to potentially upgrade your mining capacity. Here's a detailed breakdown of the three mining levels with comprehensive examples:</p>
            
            <h4>Level 1 - Basic Miner (1M - 5.99M KSH)</h4>
            <p><strong>Profile Example:</strong> John owns a small plot of land worth 2,500,000 KSH and has professional skills as a teacher valued at 1,500,000 KSH. His total validated value is 4,000,000 KSH, placing him solidly in Level 1.</p>
            <p><strong>Mining Capacity:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Daily Production: 0.005 iKb = 500 KSH per day</li>
                <li>Weekly Production: 0.035 iKb = 3,500 KSH per week</li>
                <li>Monthly Production: ~0.15 iKb = 15,000 KSH per month</li>
                <li>Annual Production: ~1.825 iKb = 182,500 KSH per year</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Level 1 is ideal for new members, those with modest asset portfolios, or individuals primarily relying on skill declarations. While the daily rate may seem small, consistent mining over months and years can accumulate significant value, especially as you declare additional assets to increase your mining level.</p>

            <h4>Level 2 - Community Miner (6M - 11.99M KSH)</h4>
            <p><strong>Profile Example:</strong> Mary owns a residential property worth 5,000,000 KSH, runs a small business valued at 3,000,000 KSH, and has certified professional skills worth 1,500,000 KSH. Her total validated value is 9,500,000 KSH, qualifying her for Level 2.</p>
            <p><strong>Mining Capacity:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Daily Production: 0.01 iKb = 1,000 KSH per day</li>
                <li>Weekly Production: 0.07 iKb = 7,000 KSH per week</li>
                <li>Monthly Production: ~0.30 iKb = 30,000 KSH per month</li>
                <li>Annual Production: ~3.65 iKb = 365,000 KSH per year</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Level 2 represents established members with moderate asset portfolios. This level doubles the mining rate of Level 1, making it a significant upgrade. Many small business owners, property owners, and professionals with multiple income streams operate at this level.</p>

            <h4>Level 3 - Sovereign Miner (12M+ KSH)</h4>
            <p><strong>Profile Example:</strong> David owns commercial property worth 8,000,000 KSH, agricultural land valued at 6,000,000 KSH, operates a medium-sized business worth 4,000,000 KSH, and has specialized professional expertise valued at 2,000,000 KSH. His total validated value is 20,000,000 KSH, placing him in Level 3.</p>
            <p><strong>Mining Capacity:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Daily Production: 0.1 iKb = 10,000 KSH per day</li>
                <li>Weekly Production: 0.7 iKb = 70,000 KSH per week</li>
                <li>Monthly Production: ~3.0 iKb = 300,000 KSH per month</li>
                <li>Annual Production: ~36.5 iKb = 3,650,000 KSH per year</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Level 3 represents high-value members with substantial asset portfolios. This premium level provides ten times the mining rate of Level 1 and five times that of Level 2. Large landowners, established business owners, and professionals with extensive asset portfolios typically operate at this level. The earning potential at Level 3 can represent a significant secondary income stream or even primary income for dedicated miners.</p>

        <h3>How to Upgrade Your Mining Level</h3>
        <p>Your mining level is not permanent—it automatically adjusts based on your total validated value in TAU Africa. To upgrade your mining level and increase your daily production rate, follow this strategic process:</p>

        <div class="info-box tip">
            <div class="info-box-title">📈 Mining Level Upgrade Strategy</div>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identify Additional Assets to Declare:</strong> Review your complete asset portfolio to identify valuable items or capabilities you haven't yet declared in TAU Africa Main App. Consider property you may have inherited, vehicles you own, business assets, equipment, professional certifications you've obtained, or specialized skills you possess. Even if you initially focused on declaring land, remember that TAU Africa values all types of assets including intellectual property, business goodwill, and service capacity.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare Documentation:</strong> Gather supporting documents for these new declarations including title deeds or land certificates for property, business registration documents for enterprises, receipts or valuation reports for vehicles and equipment, professional certificates and licenses for skills, photos and descriptions of business inventory, and any other proof of ownership or capability. Quality documentation speeds up the validation process and increases approval likelihood.</li>

        <h2>6. The Mining Process (24-Hour Cycles)</h2>

        <h3>Understanding Active Mining Cycles</h3>
        <p>KABIRU Mining operates on a unique 24-hour active participation model that distinguishes it from traditional cryptocurrency mining systems. Rather than leaving equipment running continuously, KABIRU miners must actively engage with the platform every 24 hours by initiating a new mining cycle. This active participation requirement serves multiple important purposes within the ecosystem: it ensures miners remain engaged with the TAU community and aware of ecosystem developments, it prevents abandoned accounts from accumulating unearned currency, it creates a predictable rhythm of user engagement that helps maintain system stability, and it reinforces the connection between real participation and earning rewards.</p>

        <p>Each mining cycle lasts exactly 24 hours from the moment you click the MINE button. During this 24-hour period, your iKb accumulates automatically based on your mining level, with earnings distributed evenly across each hour of the cycle. You don't need to keep your browser open or stay logged in—the mining happens on the server side once you've initiated the cycle. However, you must return within 24 hours to start your next cycle, or you will miss that day's mining opportunity.</p>

        <h3>Complete Mining Cycle Walkthrough</h3>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">1</span>
            <div class="step-title">Login to KABIRU Mining Portal</div>
            <p>Begin by navigating to https://magero1985.github.io/Tau-Africa/Kabiru-Mining-Portal/ and logging in with your TAU Africa credentials (email or Member ID and password). Upon successful login, you'll be directed to your personalized mining dashboard, which displays your current mining status, accumulated balance, mining level, and the prominent MINE button that serves as your primary interaction point with the system.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">2</span>
            <div class="step-title">Click the MINE Button</div>
            <p>Locate the large, prominently displayed MINE button on your dashboard. This button is typically styled in an eye-catching color (often gold or yellow) and positioned centrally for easy access. When you click this button, several things happen simultaneously within the system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cycle Initiation:</strong> The system records the exact timestamp of your button click and initiates a new 24-hour mining cycle starting from that precise moment. This timestamp is crucial for calculating when your current cycle will end and when you can start your next cycle.</li>
                <li><strong>Mining Status Change:</strong> Your dashboard mining status changes from "Ready to Mine" or "Mining Available" to "Mining in Progress" or "Currently Mining." This visual feedback confirms that your cycle has started successfully.</li>
                <li><strong>Countdown Timer Activation:</strong> A countdown timer appears on your dashboard showing the exact time remaining in your current 24-hour cycle. This timer counts down from 24:00:00 (hours:minutes:seconds) to 00:00:00, giving you a real-time view of your cycle progress.</li>
                <li><strong>Accumulation Begins:</strong> Your iKb balance begins accumulating immediately based on your mining level. The accumulation happens continuously throughout the 24-hour period, with small amounts added every hour.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">3</span>
            <div class="step-title">Mining Occurs Automatically</div>
            <p>Once you've initiated your mining cycle, the actual mining process happens entirely on the server side without any further action required from you. You are free to close your browser, turn off your device, or leave the KABIRU Mining portal completely—your mining will continue uninterrupted for the full 24-hour cycle. This server-side processing is what makes KABIRU Mining so accessible compared to traditional cryptocurrency mining that requires constant equipment operation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What Happens During Your Cycle:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hourly Accumulation:</strong> Your daily mining rate (0.005 iKb, 0.01 iKb, or 0.1 iKb depending on your level) is divided by 24 hours, and this hourly amount is added to your balance each hour. For example, a Level 2 miner with 0.01 iKb daily rate earns approximately 0.0004166667 iKb every hour, or about 41.67 KSH worth of iKb per hour.</li>
                <li><strong>Balance Updates:</strong> Your wallet balance updates in real-time to reflect your accumulating earnings. When you next login to check your progress, you'll see your balance has increased proportionally to the time elapsed in your cycle.</li>
                <li><strong>Cycle Progress Tracking:</strong> The system maintains a detailed log of your mining cycle, recording the start time, calculating the accumulated earnings at any given moment, tracking the remaining time in the cycle, and preparing for the cycle completion and next cycle availability.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">4</span>
            <div class="step-title">Monitor Your Cycle Progress</div>
            <p>While monitoring your cycle is not required for the mining to continue, you may wish to check your progress periodically. Login to KABIRU Mining at any point during your active cycle to view:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Countdown Timer:</strong> Shows exactly how much time remains in your current 24-hour cycle down to the second. This helps you plan when to return to start your next cycle.</li>
                <li><strong>Current Balance:</strong> Displays your total accumulated iKb, including the amount earned from your current cycle plus any previous earnings not yet withdrawn or transferred.</li>
                <li><strong>Cycle Earnings:</strong> Some dashboard configurations show specifically how much you've earned in the current cycle separate from your total balance, allowing you to see today's progress.</li>
                <li><strong>Mining Status:</strong> Confirms that mining is "Active" or "In Progress" with visual indicators like animated icons or status badges.</li>
                <li><strong>Next Cycle Availability:</strong> May display when your next mining cycle will become available, usually shown as a countdown or timestamp.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">5</span>
            <div class="step-title">Cycle Completion</div>
            <p>When your 24-hour countdown reaches zero, your mining cycle completes automatically. At this moment, several important events occur in the system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Final Earnings Credit:</strong> Your full daily mining amount (0.005 iKb, 0.01 iKb, or 0.1 iKb depending on your level) is finalized and permanently credited to your wallet balance. This amount is now yours and cannot be reversed.</li>
                <li><strong>Status Reset:</strong> Your mining status changes from "Mining in Progress" to "Ready to Mine" or "Mining Available," indicating that you can now start a new cycle.</li>
                <li><strong>MINE Button Reactivation:</strong> The MINE button becomes clickable again, changing color or appearance to show its active state. Some dashboards may display messaging like "Click MINE to start today's cycle" or "Mining available—start now!"</li>
                <li><strong>Notification:</strong> Depending on your account settings, you may receive an email or in-app notification alerting you that your mining cycle has completed and a new cycle is available to start.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Critical Timing Note:</strong> You must start your next cycle within a reasonable timeframe to avoid missing days. While the system doesn't strictly enforce an immediate action requirement, best practice is to start your new cycle within a few hours of the previous one completing. If you wait too long—for example, logging in 36 hours after your last cycle completed—you've effectively missed one full day of mining earnings that cannot be recovered. The system does not accumulate multiple days' worth of mining if you're away; each day requires active initiation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">6</span>
            <div class="step-title">Start Next Cycle</div>
            <p>To continue earning, simply click the MINE button again to initiate your next 24-hour cycle. The process repeats identically to your first cycle—24-hour countdown begins, hourly accumulation starts, and you're free to close the browser until your next cycle is ready. Consistent daily mining is the key to maximizing your earnings and building substantial iKb balance over time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-box important">
            <div class="info-box-title">⏰ Critical Timing Considerations</div>
            <p>Understanding the timing mechanics of KABIRU Mining cycles is essential for maximizing your earnings and avoiding missed opportunities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exact 24-Hour Periods:</strong> Each cycle is precisely 24 hours from the moment you click MINE. If you start a cycle at 8:00 AM on Monday, it completes at 8:00 AM on Tuesday. Your next cycle can then be started at any time after 8:00 AM Tuesday.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible Start Times:</strong> You don't need to mine at the same time every day. If you started Monday's cycle at 8:00 AM but don't login until 2:00 PM on Tuesday, you can start Tuesday's cycle at 2:00 PM. However, this means Wednesday's cycle won't be available until 2:00 PM Wednesday—your cycle times shift based on when you actually click MINE.</li>
                <li><strong>No Rollover or Accumulation:</strong> If you miss a day, those earnings are lost forever. The system does not queue up multiple days' worth of mining. If you're away for a week and login on day 8, you can only start a new single cycle—you don't get to mine for the seven days you missed.</li>
                <li><strong>Partial Cycles Don't Count:</strong> If you start a cycle but don't complete the full 24 hours before starting another cycle (which the system typically prevents anyway), you only earn for the time actually elapsed. Starting a new cycle too early may cancel the previous one, so always wait for the countdown to reach zero.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic Timing for Consistency:</strong> Many successful miners choose a consistent time each day to start their cycles—for example, always mining first thing in the morning or right before bed. This routine helps ensure you never miss a day and maximizes your annual earnings.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Daily Mining Routine Best Practices</h3>
        <p>Establishing an effective daily mining routine maximizes your earnings and minimizes the risk of missed cycles. Consider implementing these proven strategies used by successful KABIRU miners:</p>

        <h4>Morning Mining Routine</h4>
        <p>Start your mining cycle first thing in the morning as part of your waking routine. Many miners keep their phone or tablet near the bed and spend sixty seconds logging into KABIRU Mining and clicking MINE before getting out of bed. This approach has several advantages: it's done when you're fresh and unlikely to forget, it establishes mining as a daily habit linked to an existing routine (waking up), and it completes your mining responsibility for the day before work or other obligations distract you.</p>

        <h4>Evening Mining Routine</h4>
        <p>Alternatively, make mining part of your evening wind-down routine. Click MINE right before bed, perhaps after checking social media or reading news. This method ensures your cycle completes the next evening, creating a consistent daily schedule that's easy to remember. Some miners set a phone alarm for the same time each evening as a mining reminder.</p>

        <h4>Reminder Systems</h4>
        <p>Use technology to help maintain consistency. Set a daily recurring alarm on your phone labeled "KABIRU Mining" for your chosen mining time. Add a daily reminder in your calendar app with a notification. Use habit-tracking apps to mark off each day you successfully mine. Create a bookmark folder in your browser with the KABIRU Mining URL for quick access. Add the KABIRU Mining portal to your phone's home screen for one-tap access.</p>

        <h4>Backup Plans for Consistency</h4>
        <p>Life happens—unexpected events, travel, illness, or busy days can disrupt routines. Protect your mining streak with backup strategies. If you have a trusted family member or business partner who is also a TAU member, share your mining time commitment and ask them to remind you. If traveling, set multiple alarms to ensure you don't forget despite time zone changes or altered routines. Keep your login credentials securely accessible so you can mine even when away from your usual devices. Consider mining earlier than usual if you know the next day will be particularly busy or unpredictable.</p>

        <h2>7. Mining Tasks & Options</h2>

        <h3>Primary Mining Operations</h3>
        <p>KABIRU Mining's core functionality centers on the simple yet powerful daily mining cycle described in the previous section. Unlike some blockchain systems that require complex task completion or varying activities, KABIRU maintains an elegantly simple primary operation: click MINE once per 24-hour period to earn your daily production based on your validated assets and assigned mining level.</p>

        <p>This simplicity is intentional and offers several advantages. It ensures accessibility for users of all technical skill levels, from cryptocurrency experts to first-time digital currency users. It removes barriers to participation that might exclude less tech-savvy members. It allows miners to maintain their earning without significant time investment—less than one minute per day. It creates a fair, predictable reward structure where all miners at the same level earn identically regardless of technical knowledge or gaming the system.</p>

        <h3>Optional Activities and Bonus Earning</h3>
        <p>While daily mining through the MINE button is your primary earning mechanism, KABIRU Mining may offer additional optional activities that provide bonus rewards or enhanced benefits. These optional features vary by development phase and ecosystem needs, but typically include:</p>

        <h4>Referral Program Participation</h4>
        <p>One of the most valuable optional activities within KABIRU Mining is referring new members to the TAU Africa ecosystem. The referral program rewards you for growing the network and bringing new validated asset value into the system. When you successfully refer someone who completes registration, declares and validates assets, and begins mining, you typically earn a referral bonus. This bonus structure might include a one-time iKb reward when your referral starts mining, ongoing percentage bonuses on your referral's mining production for a limited time period, special recognition or status badges for top referrers, or priority access to new features being tested. The referral program is covered in comprehensive detail in Section 13 of this manual.</p>

        <h4>Educational Content Engagement</h4>
        <p>The TAU ecosystem values educated, informed members who understand the principles of Declaration Mining and the broader vision of economic sovereignty. KABIRU Mining may periodically offer bonus rewards for engaging with educational content. This might involve watching explanatory videos about asset declaration best practices, completing quizzes demonstrating understanding of mining mechanics, reading updates about ecosystem developments and roadmap progress, or participating in community discussions about economic theory and practical applications. These educational engagements help build a more informed, engaged community while providing modest bonus earnings to participants.</p>

        <h4>Ecosystem Participation Bonuses</h4>
        <p>As KABIRU Mining integrates more deeply with other TAU Africa applications, cross-platform participation may earn bonuses. For example, using your mined iKb to purchase products in TAU Global Marketplace, contributing content to TAU Tube that earns engagement, actively validating other members' asset declarations in TAU Africa Main App, participating in community governance votes or proposals, or completing transactions within the integrated TAU payment system might all trigger bonus rewards that enhance your mining earnings beyond the standard daily production.</p>

        <h4>Loyalty and Consistency Rewards</h4>
        <p>KABIRU Mining may implement loyalty programs that reward long-term, consistent participation. These might include milestone bonuses when you complete your 100th, 365th, or 1,000th consecutive mining cycle, percentage boosts to your mining rate for maintaining a perfect mining streak over extended periods (e.g., +5% bonus for 90 consecutive days, +10% for 180 days), special status tiers for veteran miners with priority support access, early access to new features, or enhanced referral bonuses. These loyalty programs incentivize consistent daily mining and reward the most dedicated community members.</p>

        <div class="info-box tip">
            <div class="info-box-title">💡 Optimizing Your Mining Strategy</div>
            <p>While daily mining is simple, strategic thinking can maximize your earnings:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Consistency Above All:</strong> Your primary focus should be maintaining a perfect daily mining streak. The cumulative earnings from consistent daily mining vastly exceed any bonuses or optional activities. Missing even a few days per month significantly reduces your annual earnings.</li>
                <li><strong>Asset Declaration Priority:</strong> Your single most impactful action is declaring additional validated assets to upgrade your mining level. The difference between levels dwarfs any bonus activity. Before spending time on optional activities, ensure you've declared all possible assets.</li>
                <li><strong>Referral Leverage:</strong> If you have an active network or social media presence, referrals can significantly boost earnings with relatively little time investment. Focus referral efforts on people likely to have substantial assets to declare (property owners, business operators, established professionals) as they'll contribute more value to the ecosystem and potentially earn you higher referral bonuses.</li>
                <li><strong>Educational Investment:</strong> Time spent understanding the TAU ecosystem, asset declaration strategies, and wealth-building principles pays dividends in better mining outcomes. Don't skip educational opportunities even if they only offer modest bonus rewards—the knowledge gained helps you optimize your overall strategy.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-Term Perspective:</strong> KABIRU Mining rewards patient, consistent participation over time rather than short-term gaming. Maintain daily mining for months and years, continuously adding validated assets, and building your referral network. The compounding effects of these consistent actions create substantial wealth over multi-year timeframes.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h3>Monitoring Your Task Completion</h3>
        <p>Your KABIRU Mining dashboard typically includes a section dedicated to tracking your activities and task completion. This might be labeled "My Activities," "Task Center," "Earnings Breakdown," or similar. Within this section, you can review your daily mining streak (consecutive days mined without missing a cycle), total mining cycles completed since account creation, referral activity and bonuses earned, educational content completed and associated bonuses, and any loyalty tier progress or milestone achievements.</p>

        <p>Regularly reviewing this section helps you understand where your earnings come from, identify opportunities you might be missing, stay motivated by seeing your consistency streak, and plan strategies for maximizing future earnings. Some miners find that tracking these metrics in a personal spreadsheet or journal enhances their engagement and helps maintain their daily mining discipline.</p>

    <section id="section8">
        <h2>8. Your Value Bank</h2>

        <h3>Understanding the Value Bank Concept</h3>
        <p>Your Value Bank, established when you declare and validate assets in TAU Africa Main App, serves as the foundation of your entire KABIRU Mining operation. This is not a traditional bank account that holds currency; rather, it is a comprehensive record of your validated real-world assets that determines your mining capacity within the ecosystem. Think of your Value Bank as a digital vault containing verified proof of your economic contribution to the TAU community—the more substantial and diverse your validated assets, the greater your mining power.</p>

        <p>The Value Bank operates on several key principles. First, it aggregates all your validated assets regardless of category—land, property, businesses, vehicles, skills, intellectual property, and any other declared items are summed together to create your total validated value. Second, it updates dynamically as you add new asset declarations that complete the validation process, automatically adjusting your mining level when your total crosses tier thresholds. Third, it maintains a permanent, auditable record of each validated asset with its assigned value, supporting documentation, validation history, and the date it was approved. Finally, it serves as your financial credibility indicator within the TAU ecosystem, as your validated value may influence access to other TAU services, lending eligibility, or investment opportunities in future ecosystem developments.</p>

        <h3>Accessing Your Value Bank Information</h3>
        <p>While your Value Bank is primarily managed within TAU Africa Main App (https://magero1985.github.io/Tau-Africa/), key summary information is displayed within your KABIRU Mining dashboard for convenient reference. When you login to KABIRU Mining, your dashboard typically shows your total validated value (the sum of all approved asset declarations in KSH), the breakdown of value by major categories (e.g., "Physical Property: 6M KSH, Business Assets: 3M KSH, Skills: 1.5M KSH"), your current mining level based on this total (Level 1, 2, or 3), and how close you are to the next mining level threshold if applicable (e.g., "1.5M KSH away from Level 2").</p>

        <p>For detailed Value Bank management—reviewing individual asset declarations, adding new declarations, updating information on existing assets, or checking validation status—you must login to TAU Africa Main App. This separation ensures that asset validation occurs within the proper context with full community oversight, while KABIRU Mining focuses specifically on the mining operations enabled by those validated assets.</p>

        <h3>Growing Your Value Bank</h3>
        <p>Increasing the total value in your Value Bank is the single most effective strategy for increasing your KABIRU Mining earnings. Since your mining level (and thus your daily production rate) is determined solely by your total validated value, every additional asset you declare and validate directly enhances your earning potential. The process for growing your Value Bank involves several strategic steps:</p>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">1</span>
            <div class="step-title">Comprehensive Asset Inventory</div>
            <p>Begin by conducting a thorough inventory of everything you own or control that might have economic value. This inventory should be exhaustive, considering assets you might initially overlook:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Property:</strong> All land parcels (even small plots), residential homes or apartments you own, rental properties generating income, commercial buildings or retail spaces, agricultural land under cultivation or leased out, undeveloped land held for future use, and shared family property where you have partial ownership rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Vehicles and Equipment:</strong> Personal cars, motorcycles, and bicycles, commercial vehicles like trucks or vans, agricultural equipment (tractors, plows, irrigation systems), construction equipment, business machinery, and recreational vehicles or boats.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Assets:</strong> Operating businesses with registration documentation, business inventory and stock, furniture and fixtures in business premises, specialized equipment or tools, intellectual property developed for the business, and business goodwill or brand value.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Skills:</strong> Professional certifications and licenses (medical, legal, engineering), trade qualifications (plumbing, electrical, carpentry), specialized expertise with market value, teaching and training capabilities, consulting knowledge in specific domains, and language proficiencies with commercial application.</li>
                <li><strong>Intellectual and Digital Assets:</strong> Copyrights on creative works, patents on inventions or processes, trademarks and brand names you control, software or applications you've developed, and websites or digital platforms you own.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Create a detailed list of every asset with estimated market value. Don't self-censor at this stage—include items even if you're unsure whether they qualify for declaration. The validation process will determine acceptability, but starting with a comprehensive list ensures you don't leave value on the table.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">2</span>
            <div class="step-title">Documentation Preparation</div>
            <p>For each asset you plan to declare, assemble supporting documentation that will facilitate smooth validation. Quality documentation significantly speeds approval and increases the likelihood validators accept your stated values. Required or helpful documents typically include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For Property:</strong> Title deeds, land registration certificates, property tax records, recent valuation reports, survey maps, and clear photographs showing the property boundaries and structures.</li>
                <li><strong>For Vehicles:</strong> Vehicle registration certificates (logbooks), purchase receipts or invoices, insurance valuation, photos from multiple angles, and maintenance records demonstrating good condition.</li>
                <li><strong>For Businesses:</strong> Business registration certificates, operating licenses, recent financial statements or tax filings, inventory lists with photographs, and customer contracts or evidence of operations.</li>
                <li><strong>For Skills:</strong> Professional certificates and degrees, licenses to practice, portfolio of work completed, client testimonials or letters of recommendation, and evidence of rates charged or income earned from these skills.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>High-quality photos are essential for many asset types. Use good lighting, take multiple angles, and ensure documents are clearly legible when photographed. Scan important documents rather than photographing them when possible for better clarity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">3</span>
            <div class="step-title">Strategic Value Assessment</div>
            <p>Before declaring assets in TAU Africa Main App, carefully research appropriate market values for each item. Your goal is to declare honest, defensible values that validators will approve. Values that are too high risk rejection and validation delays, while values that are too low leave mining capacity unclaimed.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Property Values:</strong> Research recent sales of comparable properties in your area, consult with local real estate agents for informal valuations, check government property tax assessments, and consider hiring a professional appraiser for high-value properties.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Values:</strong> Use standard business valuation methods such as asset-based valuation (sum of all business assets minus liabilities), income-based valuation (multiple of annual profits), or market-based valuation (comparison to similar businesses sold recently).</li>
                <li><strong>Skill Values:</strong> Calculate base

        <div class="info-box-title">🎯 Value Bank Growth Examples</div>
        <p><strong>Case Study: Sarah's Journey from Level 1 to Level 3</strong></p>
        <p>Sarah initially registered with TAU Africa declaring only her primary residence valued at 3,500,000 KSH, qualifying her for Level 1 mining (0.005 iKb/day = 15,000 KSH/month).</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 1 - First Upgrade:</strong> Three months later, Sarah realized she hadn't declared her vehicle (worth 1,800,000 KSH), her small trading business (worth 2,200,000 KSH), or her professional skills as a certified accountant (worth 1,500,000 KSH). She prepared documentation and declared these assets. After validation, her total reached 9,000,000 KSH, upgrading her to Level 2 (0.01 iKb/day = 30,000 KSH/month). Her monthly earnings doubled.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 2 - Second Upgrade:</strong> Six months later, Sarah inherited agricultural land from her family that she had shared ownership in (her portion valued at 4,000,000 KSH). She also obtained additional professional certifications that enhanced her skill value to 2,000,000 KSH. After declaring and validating these, her total reached 15,000,000 KSH, upgrading her to Level 3 (0.1 iKb/day = 300,000 KSH/month). Her monthly earnings were now twenty times her initial Level 1 rate.</p>
        <p><strong>Total Transformation:</strong> Through strategic asset declaration over nine months, Sarah increased her monthly mining income from 15,000 KSH to 300,000 KSH—a 2,000% increase—simply by properly documenting and validating assets she already owned.</p>

    <h3>Value Bank Maintenance and Updates</h3>
    <p>Your Value Bank requires periodic maintenance to ensure accuracy and maximize your mining potential. Consider these ongoing management practices:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Annual Review:</strong> Once per year, review your complete Value Bank to identify assets whose value has changed significantly (property appreciation, business growth, new certifications obtained) and update declarations accordingly. Some increases in asset values may push you to the next mining level threshold.</li>
        <li><strong>New Asset Integration:</strong> Whenever you acquire new significant assets (purchase property, start a business, obtain professional certification), immediately declare them in TAU Africa to capture the additional mining capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation Updates:</strong> If validators request additional information on existing declarations, respond promptly with requested documentation to maintain or increase your validated values.</li>
        <li><strong>Asset Disposals:</strong> If you sell or lose control of declared assets, update your Value Bank accordingly to maintain accuracy. While this may reduce your mining level, maintaining honesty preserves your credibility for future declarations and ensures ecosystem integrity.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- SECTION 9 -->
    <section id="section9">
        <h2>9. Currency Conversions (iKb, iKbp, KSH)</h2>

        <h3>Understanding the TAU Currency Ecosystem</h3>
        <p>The TAU Africa ecosystem operates with multiple interconnected currency units that serve different purposes across various applications. Understanding these currencies and their conversion relationships is essential for effectively managing your earnings, transferring value between applications, and ultimately withdrawing cash. This multi-currency structure may initially seem complex, but it provides flexibility and enables seamless integration across the entire TAU ecosystem while maintaining stable value relationships.</p>

        <h3>The Three Primary Currency Units</h3>

        <h4>1. iKb (iKabiru) - Primary Mining Currency</h4>
        <p>iKb is the primary unit of currency mined in KABIRU Mining and represents the highest value denomination within the TAU ecosystem. This is the currency you accumulate through your daily mining cycles based on your mining level. iKb serves as the backbone currency of the ecosystem with several critical characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stable Value:</strong> 1 iKb equals exactly 100,000 KSH (Kenyan Shillings) or the equivalent in other local currencies (UGX, TSH, etc.). This fixed exchange rate provides predictability and stability, unlike volatile cryptocurrencies whose value fluctuates dramatically.</li>
            <li><strong>Asset-Backed:</strong> Each iKb in circulation is backed by validated real-world assets declared by TAU members. The total amount of iKb that can be mined is proportional to the total validated asset pool in the ecosystem, ensuring every unit represents genuine economic value.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdrawable to Cash:</strong> iKb is the currency unit used for cash withdrawals. When you request a withdrawal, the amount is specified in iKb and converted to local currency at the standard rate for payment via mobile money or bank transfer.</li>
            <li><strong>Mining Production Rates:</strong> All mining levels produce iKb as their primary output—Level 1 produces 0.005 iKb daily, Level 2 produces 0.01 iKb daily, and Level 3 produces 0.1 iKb daily.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. iKbp (iKabiru Points) - Ecosystem Activity Currency</h4>
        <p>iKbp represents fractional units of iKb and serves as the transactional currency within other TAU ecosystem applications, particularly TAU Tube (the video platform) and TAU Global Marketplace. iKbp makes small-value transactions practical and provides a psychologically accessible currency for everyday ecosystem interactions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Conversion Rate:</strong> 10,000 iKbp equals exactly 1 iKb. This means 1 iKbp equals 10 KSH in real money value. This fractional relationship allows for granular rewards and small transactions that would be impractical with whole iKb units.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Uses:</strong> Earning rewards for watching videos on TAU Tube (typically 1-5 iKbp per video), receiving tips and gifts from viewers as a content creator, purchasing small items in TAU Global Marketplace, referral bonuses in various applications, and micro-transactions for ecosystem services.</li>
            <li><strong>Accumulation Strategy:</strong> Members typically accumulate iKbp through ecosystem activities, then periodically convert accumulated iKbp to iKb when they reach the 10,000 iKbp threshold. This conversion can happen within individual applications or by transferring iKbp to KABIRU Mining for consolidation.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Platform Transferability:</strong> iKbp earned in TAU Tube can be transferred to KABIRU Mining, used in TAU Marketplace, or consolidated across all platforms under your single TAU Member ID, providing unified earnings across the entire ecosystem.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. KSH (and Other Local Currencies) - Fiat Currency</h4>
        <p>KSH (Kenyan Shillings) and other local African currencies (UGX for Uganda, TSH for Tanzania, RWF for Rwanda, etc.) represent traditional fiat money that you ultimately receive when withdrawing from KABIRU Mining. These are the currencies deposited to your mobile money account (M-Pesa, Airtel Money, MTN Mobile Money) or bank account:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fixed Conversion Rate:</strong> 1 iKb always equals 100,000 units of local currency. This rate is maintained regardless of external market fluctuations, providing stability and predictability for miners planning their earnings and withdrawals.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdrawal Currency:</strong> All cash withdrawals from KABIRU Mining are processed in local currency. You request withdrawal of a specific iKb amount, and you receive the equivalent in KSH or your local currency based on the fixed conversion rate.</li>
            <li><strong>Regional Adaptation:</strong> The TAU system automatically adjusts to your registered location and processes withdrawals in your appropriate local currency, though the underlying value relationships remain constant across all regions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Comprehensive Conversion Tables</h3>
        <p>The following tables provide quick reference for converting between all currency units within the TAU ecosystem, helping you quickly calculate values across different applications and contexts:</p>

        <h3>Converting Between Currency Units</h3>
        <p>Conversion between iKbp and iKb typically happens in two contexts within the KABIRU Mining application:</p>

        <h4>Receiving iKbp from Other Applications</h4>
        <p>If you earn iKbp through activities in TAU Tube or TAU Global Marketplace, these points can be transferred to your KABIRU Mining wallet. Once transferred, you may have options to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keep as iKbp:</strong> Maintain the points in iKbp form if you plan to use them for ecosystem transactions that accept iKbp.</li>
            <li><strong>Convert to iKb:</strong> When you accumulate 10,000 iKbp or more, convert them to whole iKb units (10,000 iKbp becomes 1 iKb) for easier management and to meet withdrawal minimums.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Internal Conversion Process</h4>
        <p>To convert iKbp to iKb within KABIRU Mining:</p>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">1</span>
            <div class="step-title">Access Your Wallet Dashboard</div>
            <p>Login to KABIRU Mining and navigate to your wallet or balance section. Here you'll see separate balances for iKb and iKbp if you have both currency types.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">2</span>
            <div class="step-title">Locate Conversion Tool</div>
            <p>Find the "Convert iKbp to iKb" option, button, or link. This may be within your wallet interface or in a dedicated "Currency Exchange" section.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">3</span>
            <div class="step-title">Enter Conversion Amount</div>
            <p>Specify how many iKbp you wish to convert. The system typically requires minimum conversion amounts (often 10,000 iKbp = 1 iKb) and shows you the equivalent iKb amount you'll receive. The conversion rate is always exactly 10,000:1 with no fees or markup.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">4</span>
            <div class="step-title">Confirm Conversion</div>
            <p>Review the conversion details and confirm. The conversion happens instantly—your iKbp balance decreases by the specified amount and your iKb balance increases by the corresponding amount.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-box tip">
            <div class="info-box-title">💡 Currency Management Best Practices</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consolidate Regularly:</strong> If you're active across multiple TAU applications earning iKbp, periodically transfer and convert these earnings to iKb in KABIRU Mining. This consolidation provides a clearer picture of your total wealth within the ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic Conversion Timing:</strong> Convert iKbp to iKb when you reach convenient round numbers (10,000, 50,000, 100,000 iKbp) to avoid dealing with fractional iKb amounts that may complicate calculations.</li>
                <li><strong>Track Both Currencies:</strong> Maintain personal records of both your iKb (from mining) and iKbp (from ecosystem activities) to understand your complete earning picture. Some miners keep simple spreadsheets tracking daily mining plus monthly ecosystem activity bonuses.</li>
                <li><strong>Understand Withdrawal Currency:</strong> Remember that only iKb can be withdrawn as cash. If you need to withdraw funds, ensure you've converted sufficient iKbp to iKb first to meet withdrawal minimums and your desired withdrawal amount.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>10. Wallet Management</h2>

        <h3>Your KABIRU Wallet Overview</h3>
        <p>Your KABIRU wallet is a secure digital repository automatically created when you link your TAU Member ID to KABIRU Mining. This wallet functions as your personal bank account within the TAU ecosystem, storing all iKb currency you mine, tracking your complete transaction history, enabling transfers to other TAU applications or members, and facilitating cash withdrawal requests to convert your digital earnings into spendable money. The wallet is uniquely tied to your Member ID and email address, ensuring only you can access and manage your accumulated iKb balance.</p>

        <h3>Wallet Dashboard Features</h3>
        <p>Your wallet dashboard, accessible immediately upon logging into KABIRU Mining, provides comprehensive visibility into your financial status within the ecosystem. The dashboard typically includes the following key information sections:</p>

        <h4>Current Balance Display</h4>
        <p>The most prominent feature shows your available iKb balance—the total amount you've mined and accumulated that is currently available for withdrawal or transfer. This balance updates in real-time as you complete mining cycles. The display typically shows the balance in multiple formats: iKb amount with decimal precision (e.g., "2.475 iKb"), KSH equivalent value (e.g., "247,500 KSH"), and sometimes iKbp equivalent for reference (e.g., "24,750 iKbp"). This multi-format display helps you quickly understand your wealth in the currency unit most relevant to your current need—whether planning a withdrawal (iKb), budgeting in real money (KSH), or considering ecosystem transactions (iKbp).</p>

        <h4>Balance Breakdown</h4>
        <p>More detailed wallet interfaces provide breakdown of your balance across different categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Available Balance:</strong> iKb that can be withdrawn or transferred immediately with no restrictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Pending Balance:</strong> iKb from very recent mining cycles that may be in a brief verification period before becoming available (typically cleared within 24 hours of cycle completion).</li>
            <li><strong>Reserved Balance:</strong> iKb you've allocated to special programs like lockup staking, reserve funds, or other ecosystem commitments that temporarily restrict access in exchange for potential bonuses or benefits.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifetime Earnings:</strong> Total cumulative iKb you've earned since beginning mining operations, providing perspective on your overall ecosystem participation and success.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Transaction History</h4>
        <p>A comprehensive log of all wallet activities provides transparency and enables personal financial tracking:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mining Cycle Completions:</strong> Each daily mining cycle appears as a separate transaction showing the date completed, the iKb amount earned (0.005, 0.01, or 0.1 based on your level at that time), and confirmation status.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdrawals:</strong> All cash withdrawal requests are logged with the date requested, iKb amount converted, KSH equivalent received, payment method (M-Pesa, bank transfer, etc.), and processing status (pending, completed, or cancelled).</li>
            <li><strong>Transfers:</strong> Any iKb or iKbp transferred to or from other TAU applications or members shows with full details including recipient/sender information, amount, date, and purpose if specified.</li>
            <li><strong>Conversions:</strong> Currency conversions between iKbp and iKb are logged for your records.</li>
            <li><strong>Bonuses and Adjustments:</strong> Referral bonuses, loyalty rewards, competition prizes, or any administrative adjustments appear with explanatory notes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Transaction history can typically be filtered by date range, transaction type, or searched by specific keywords, making it easy to locate particular transactions or generate personal financial reports. Many miners export this history monthly for personal bookkeeping or tax preparation purposes.</p>

        <h4>Mining Statistics</h4>
        <p>Performance metrics help you track your mining consistency and optimize your strategy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Current Mining Streak:</strong> Number of consecutive days you've successfully mined without missing a cycle, motivating consistent participation.</li>
            <li><strong>Total Mining Days:</strong> Cumulative days you've completed mining cycles since account creation, showing your overall commitment level.</li>
            <li><strong>Current Mining Level:</strong> Your active level (1, 2, or 3) with daily production rate and total validated asset value backing this level.</li>
            <li><strong>Average Daily Earnings:</strong> Your mean iKb earned per day over various time periods (last week, last month, all time), helping you understand your typical earning pace.</li>
            <li><strong>Projected Monthly Earnings:</strong> Based on your current mining level and recent consistency, an estimate of your end-of-month expected earnings, useful for financial planning.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Wallet Security Features</h3>
        <p>KABIRU Mining implements multiple layers of security to protect your earned currency and prevent unauthorized access to your wallet:</p>

        <h4>Authentication Requirements</h4>
        <p>Every wallet access requires your standard login credentials (email or Member ID plus password). For sensitive operations like withdrawals or large transfers, additional authentication may be required including email verification (clicking a confirmation link sent to your registered email), SMS verification codes (entering a one-time code sent to your registered phone number), or security question challenges (answering questions you set up during registration). These multi-factor authentication measures significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if someone obtains your password.</p>

        <h4>Withdrawal Verification</h4>
        <p>All withdrawal requests trigger special verification procedures beyond standard login. The system may require confirmation via email link before processing the withdrawal, SMS code entry to authorize the transaction, and review of withdrawal destination to ensure it matches your registered mobile money or bank account details. For large withdrawals exceeding certain thresholds, additional administrative review may occur to prevent fraud or account compromise.</p>

        <h4>Activity Monitoring</h4>
        <p>The KABIRU system continuously monitors wallet activity for suspicious patterns that might indicate unauthorized access or fraud attempts. Unusual activities that trigger alerts include login attempts from new geographic locations significantly different from your historical patterns, multiple failed login attempts suggesting password guessing attacks, withdrawal requests to new payment accounts not previously used, unusually large withdrawals significantly exceeding your typical patterns, or rapid consecutive transactions that don't match normal user behavior. When suspicious activity is detected, the system may temporarily lock your wallet and require verification of your identity before restoring access, protecting your accumulated earnings from theft.</p>

        <h3>Wallet Management Best Practices</h3>
        <p>Implementing smart wallet management habits enhances security, maximizes earning potential, and provides financial clarity:</p>

        <div class="info-box tip">
            <div class="info-box-title">🔐 Wallet Security Guidelines</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strong Unique Password:</strong> Use a complex password of 12+ characters combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Never reuse passwords from other accounts. Consider using a password manager to generate and store secure passwords.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Balance Checks:</strong> Login at least weekly (preferably daily when starting your mining cycle) to review your balance and transaction history. Catching unauthorized transactions early enables faster resolution.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Devices:</strong> Only access your KABIRU wallet from devices you personally control and trust. Avoid logging into wallets on public computers in internet cafes, libraries, or shared work computers where keyloggers or session hijacking risks exist.</li>
                <li><strong>Updated Contact Information:</strong> Ensure your registered email and phone number remain current and accessible. These are critical for withdrawal notifications, security alerts, and account recovery if needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Document Large Transactions:</strong> Keep personal records of all significant withdrawals including date, amount, destination account, and confirmation numbers. This documentation assists in resolving any payment delays or discrepancies.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Withdrawals:</strong> Rather than accumulating massive balances over long periods, consider regular monthly or quarterly withdrawals. This reduces the potential loss if security issues occur and helps you realize tangible value from your mining efforts regularly.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Troubleshooting Common Wallet Issues</h3>

        <h4>Balance Discrepancies</h4>
        <p>If your displayed balance seems incorrect or doesn't match your expectations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check your transaction history for all recent mining cycles—ensure each cycle you completed is properly logged with the correct earning amount for your level.</li>
            <li>Look for any withdrawals or transfers you may have forgotten about that reduced your balance.</li>
            <li>Refresh your browser or logout and login again to force a balance update—sometimes display caching causes temporary incorrect displays.</li>
            <li>Verify you're viewing "Available Balance" rather than "Total Balance" which might include pending or reserved amounts not yet accessible.</li>
            <li>If discrepancies persist after 24 hours, contact TAU support with your Member ID, the expected balance, the displayed balance, and relevant transaction dates for investigation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Missing Transactions</h4>
        <p>If a mining cycle completion or other transaction doesn't appear in your history:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wait 24 hours for transaction processing—some transactions have deliberate delays for security verification before appearing.</li>
            <li>Check that you actually completed the action you're looking for—for mining cycles, ensure you clicked MINE and saw the confirmation rather than assuming it happened.</li>
            <li>Review your transaction history filters—you may have an active date range or type filter hiding the transaction you're seeking.</li>
            <li>Verify you're logged into the correct account—if you have multiple TAU Member IDs or email addresses, ensure you're checking the right wallet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Locked or Inaccessible Wallet</h4>
        <p>If you cannot access your wallet due to login issues or account locks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the "Forgot Password" feature if password issues are preventing login—reset link will be sent to your registered email.</li>
            <li>Check your email for security alert messages that may explain why your account was locked and provide unlock procedures.</li>
            <li>If locked due to suspicious activity detection, follow the identity verification process provided in the lock notification to restore access.</li>
            <li>Contact TAU support with your Member ID, registered email, and explanation of the issue if standard unlock procedures don't resolve the problem within 48 hours.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11. Cash Withdrawal Process</h2>

        <h3>Converting Digital iKb to Spendable Cash</h3>
        <p>The cash withdrawal process represents the culmination of your KABIRU Mining efforts—the moment when your accumulated digital currency converts into real money you can spend, save, invest, or use to improve your family's quality of life. TAU Africa has designed a withdrawal system that balances accessibility (enabling members to regularly access their earnings), security (preventing fraud and protecting member accounts), and ecosystem stability (maintaining the value of iKb and ensuring sustainable liquidity). Understanding this process completely ensures smooth, successful withdrawals every time you need to convert your mined iKb into

        <h2>9. Currency Conversions (iKb, iKbp, KSH)</h2>

        <h3>Understanding the TAU Currency Ecosystem</h3>
        <p>The TAU Africa ecosystem operates with multiple interconnected currency units that serve different purposes across various applications. Understanding these currencies and their conversion relationships is essential for effectively managing your earnings, transferring value between applications, and ultimately withdrawing cash. This multi-currency structure may initially seem complex, but it provides flexibility and enables seamless integration across the entire TAU ecosystem while maintaining stable value relationships.</p>

        <h3>The Three Primary Currency Units</h3>

        <h4>1. iKb (iKabiru) - Primary Mining Currency</h4>
        <p>iKb is the primary unit of currency mined in KABIRU Mining and represents the highest value denomination within the TAU ecosystem. This is the currency you accumulate through your daily mining cycles based on your mining level. iKb serves as the backbone currency of the ecosystem with several critical characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stable Value:</strong> 1 iKb equals exactly 100,000 KSH (Kenyan Shillings) or the equivalent in other local currencies (UGX, TSH, etc.). This fixed exchange rate provides predictability and stability, unlike volatile cryptocurrencies whose value fluctuates dramatically.</li>
            <li><strong>Asset-Backed:</strong> Each iKb in circulation is backed by validated real-world assets declared by TAU members. The total amount of iKb that can be mined is proportional to the total validated asset pool in the ecosystem, ensuring every unit represents genuine economic value.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdrawable to Cash:</strong> iKb is the currency unit used for cash withdrawals. When you request a withdrawal, the amount is specified in iKb and converted to local currency at the standard rate for payment via mobile money or bank transfer.</li>
            <li><strong>Mining Production Rates:</strong> All mining levels produce iKb as their primary output—Level 1 produces 0.005 iKb daily, Level 2 produces 0.01 iKb daily, and Level 3 produces 0.1 iKb daily.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. iKbp (iKabiru Points) - Ecosystem Activity Currency</h4>
        <p>iKbp represents fractional units of iKb and serves as the transactional currency within other TAU ecosystem applications, particularly TAU Tube (the video platform) and TAU Global Marketplace. iKbp makes small-value transactions practical and provides a psychologically accessible currency for everyday ecosystem interactions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Conversion Rate:</strong> 10,000 iKbp equals exactly 1 iKb. This means 1 iKbp equals 10 KSH in real money value. This fractional relationship allows for granular rewards and small transactions that would be impractical with whole iKb units.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Uses:</strong> Earning rewards for watching videos on TAU Tube (typically 1-5 iKbp per video), receiving tips and gifts from viewers as a content creator, purchasing small items in TAU Global Marketplace, referral bonuses in various applications, and micro-transactions for ecosystem services.</li>
            <li><strong>Accumulation Strategy:</strong> Members typically accumulate iKbp through ecosystem activities, then periodically convert accumulated iKbp to iKb when they reach the 10,000 iKbp threshold. This conversion can happen within individual applications or by transferring iKbp to KABIRU Mining for consolidation.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Platform Transferability:</strong> iKbp earned in TAU Tube can be transferred to KABIRU Mining, used in TAU Marketplace, or consolidated across all platforms under your single TAU Member ID, providing unified earnings across the entire ecosystem.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. KSH (and Other Local Currencies) - Fiat Currency</h4>
        <p>KSH (Kenyan Shillings) and other local African currencies (UGX for Uganda, TSH for Tanzania, RWF for Rwanda, etc.) represent traditional fiat money that you ultimately receive when withdrawing from KABIRU Mining. These are the currencies deposited to your mobile money account (M-Pesa, Airtel Money, MTN Mobile Money) or bank account:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fixed Conversion Rate:</strong> 1 iKb always equals 100,000 units of local currency. This rate is maintained regardless of external market fluctuations, providing stability and predictability for miners planning their earnings and withdrawals.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdrawal Currency:</strong> All cash withdrawals from KABIRU Mining are processed in local currency. You request withdrawal of a specific iKb amount, and you receive the equivalent in KSH or your local currency based on the fixed conversion rate.</li>
            <li><strong>Regional Adaptation:</strong> The TAU system automatically adjusts to your registered location and processes withdrawals in your appropriate local currency, though the underlying value relationships remain constant across all regions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Comprehensive Conversion Tables</h3>
        <p>The following tables provide quick reference for converting between all currency units within the TAU ecosystem, helping you quickly calculate values across different applications and contexts:</p>

        <h3>Converting Between Currency Units</h3>
        <p>Conversion between iKbp and iKb typically happens in two contexts within the KABIRU Mining application:</p>

        <h4>Receiving iKbp from Other Applications</h4>
        <p>If you earn iKbp through activities in TAU Tube or TAU Global Marketplace, these points can be transferred to your KABIRU Mining wallet. Once transferred, you may have options to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keep as iKbp:</strong> Maintain the points in iKbp form if you plan to use them for ecosystem transactions that accept iKbp.</li>
            <li><strong>Convert to iKb:</strong> When you accumulate 10,000 iKbp or more, convert them to whole iKb units (10,000 iKbp becomes 1 iKb) for easier management and to meet withdrawal minimums.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Internal Conversion Process</h4>
        <p>To convert iKbp to iKb within KABIRU Mining:</p>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">1</span>
            <div class="step-title">Access Your Wallet Dashboard</div>
            <p>Login to KABIRU Mining and navigate to your wallet or balance section. Here you'll see separate balances for iKb and iKbp if you have both currency types.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">2</span>
            <div class="step-title">Locate Conversion Tool</div>
            <p>Find the "Convert iKbp to iKb" option, button, or link. This may be within your wallet interface or in a dedicated "Currency Exchange" section.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">3</span>
            <div class="step-title">Enter Conversion Amount</div>
            <p>Specify how many iKbp you wish to convert. The system typically requires minimum conversion amounts (often 10,000 iKbp = 1 iKb) and shows you the equivalent iKb amount you'll receive. The conversion rate is always exactly 10,000:1 with no fees or markup.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">4</span>
            <div class="step-title">Confirm Conversion</div>
            <p>Review the conversion details and confirm. The conversion happens instantly—your iKbp balance decreases by the specified amount and your iKb balance increases by the corresponding amount.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-box tip">
            <div class="info-box-title">💡 Currency Management Best Practices</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consolidate Regularly:</strong> If you're active across multiple TAU applications earning iKbp, periodically transfer and convert these earnings to iKb in KABIRU Mining. This consolidation provides a clearer picture of your total wealth within the ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic Conversion Timing:</strong> Convert iKbp to iKb when you reach convenient round numbers (10,000, 50,000, 100,000 iKbp) to avoid dealing with fractional iKb amounts that may complicate calculations.</li>
                <li><strong>Track Both Currencies:</strong> Maintain personal records of both your iKb (from mining) and iKbp (from ecosystem activities) to understand your complete earning picture. Some miners keep simple spreadsheets tracking daily mining plus monthly ecosystem activity bonuses.</li>
                <li><strong>Understand Withdrawal Currency:</strong> Remember that only iKb can be withdrawn as cash. If you need to withdraw funds, ensure you've converted sufficient iKbp to iKb first to meet withdrawal minimums and your desired withdrawal amount.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <!-- SECTION 10 -->
    <section id="section10">
        <h2>10. Wallet Management</h2>

        <h3>Your KABIRU Wallet Overview</h3>
        <p>Your KABIRU wallet is a secure digital repository automatically created when you link your TAU Member ID to KABIRU Mining. This wallet functions as your personal bank account within the TAU ecosystem, storing all iKb currency you mine, tracking your complete transaction history, enabling transfers to other TAU applications or members, and facilitating cash withdrawal requests to convert your digital earnings into spendable money. The wallet is uniquely tied to your Member ID and email address, ensuring only you can access and manage your accumulated iKb balance.</p>

        <h3>Wallet Dashboard Features</h3>
        <p>Your wallet dashboard, accessible immediately upon logging into KABIRU Mining, provides comprehensive visibility into your financial status within the ecosystem. The dashboard typically includes the following key information sections:</p>

        <h4>Current Balance Display</h4>
        <p>The most prominent feature shows your available iKb balance—the total amount you've mined and accumulated that is currently available for withdrawal or transfer. This balance updates in real-time as you complete mining cycles. The display typically shows the balance in multiple formats: iKb amount with decimal precision (e.g., "2.475 iKb"), KSH equivalent value (e.g., "247,500 KSH"), and sometimes iKbp equivalent for reference (e.g., "24,750 iKbp"). This multi-format display helps you quickly understand your wealth in the currency unit most relevant to your current need—whether planning a withdrawal (iKb), budgeting in real money (KSH), or considering ecosystem transactions (iKbp).</p>

        <h4>Balance Breakdown</h4>
        <p>More detailed wallet interfaces provide breakdown of your balance across different categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Available Balance:</strong> iKb that can be withdrawn or transferred immediately with no restrictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Pending Balance:</strong> iKb from very recent mining cycles that may be in a brief verification period before becoming available (typically cleared within 24 hours of cycle completion).</li>
            <li><strong>Reserved Balance:</strong> iKb you've allocated to special programs like lockup staking, reserve funds, or other ecosystem commitments that temporarily restrict access in exchange for potential bonuses or benefits.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifetime Earnings:</strong> Total cumulative iKb you've earned since beginning mining operations, providing perspective on your overall ecosystem participation and success.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Transaction History</h4>
        <p>A comprehensive log of all wallet activities provides transparency and enables personal financial tracking:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mining Cycle Completions:</strong> Each daily mining cycle appears as a separate transaction showing the date completed, the iKb amount earned (0.005, 0.01, or 0.1 based on your level at that time), and confirmation status.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdrawals:</strong> All cash withdrawal requests are logged with the date requested, iKb amount converted, KSH equivalent received, payment method (M-Pesa, bank transfer, etc.), and processing status (pending, completed, or cancelled).</li>
            <li><strong>Transfers:</strong> Any iKb or iKbp transferred to or from other TAU applications or members shows with full details including recipient/sender information, amount, date, and purpose if specified.</li>
            <li><strong>Conversions:</strong> Currency conversions between iKbp and iKb are logged for your records.</li>
            <li><strong>Bonuses and Adjustments:</strong> Referral bonuses, loyalty rewards, competition prizes, or any administrative adjustments appear with explanatory notes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Transaction history can typically be filtered by date range, transaction type, or searched by specific keywords, making it easy to locate particular transactions or generate personal financial reports. Many miners export this history monthly for personal bookkeeping or tax preparation purposes.</p>

        <h4>Mining Statistics</h4>
        <p>Performance metrics help you track your mining consistency and optimize your strategy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Current Mining Streak:</strong> Number of consecutive days you've successfully mined without missing a cycle, motivating consistent participation.</li>
            <li><strong>Total Mining Days:</strong> Cumulative days you've completed mining cycles since account creation, showing your overall commitment level.</li>
            <li><strong>Current Mining Level:</strong> Your active level (1, 2, or 3) with daily production rate and total validated asset value backing this level.</li>
            <li><strong>Average Daily Earnings:</strong> Your mean iKb earned per day over various time periods (last week, last month, all time), helping you understand your typical earning pace.</li>
            <li><strong>Projected Monthly Earnings:</strong> Based on your current mining level and recent consistency, an estimate of your end-of-month expected earnings, useful for financial planning.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Wallet Security Features</h3>
        <p>KABIRU Mining implements multiple layers of security to protect your earned currency and prevent unauthorized access to your wallet:</p>

        <h4>Authentication Requirements</h4>
        <p>Every wallet access requires your standard login credentials (email or Member ID plus password). For sensitive operations like withdrawals or large transfers, additional authentication may be required including email verification (clicking a confirmation link sent to your registered email), SMS verification codes (entering a one-time code sent to your registered phone number), or security question challenges (answering questions you set up during registration). These multi-factor authentication measures significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if someone obtains your password.</p>

        <h4>Withdrawal Verification</h4>
        <p>All withdrawal requests trigger special verification procedures beyond standard login. The system may require confirmation via email link before processing the withdrawal, SMS code entry to authorize the transaction, and review of withdrawal destination to ensure it matches your registered mobile money or bank account details. For large withdrawals exceeding certain thresholds, additional administrative review may occur to prevent fraud or account compromise.</p>

        <h4>Activity Monitoring</h4>
        <p>The KABIRU system continuously monitors wallet activity for suspicious patterns that might indicate unauthorized access or fraud attempts. Unusual activities that trigger alerts include login attempts from new geographic locations significantly different from your historical patterns, multiple failed login attempts suggesting password guessing attacks, withdrawal requests to new payment accounts not previously used, unusually large withdrawals significantly exceeding your typical patterns, or rapid consecutive transactions that don't match normal user behavior. When suspicious activity is detected, the system may temporarily lock your wallet and require verification of your identity before restoring access, protecting your accumulated earnings from theft.</p>

        <h3>Wallet Management Best Practices</h3>
        <p>Implementing smart wallet management habits enhances security, maximizes earning potential, and provides financial clarity:</p>

        <div class="info-box tip">
            <div class="info-box-title">🔐 Wallet Security Guidelines</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strong Unique Password:</strong> Use a complex password of 12+ characters combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Never reuse passwords from other accounts. Consider using a password manager to generate and store secure passwords.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Balance Checks:</strong> Login at least weekly (preferably daily when starting your mining cycle) to review your balance and transaction history. Catching unauthorized transactions early enables faster resolution.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Devices:</strong> Only access your KABIRU wallet from devices you personally control and trust. Avoid logging into wallets on public computers in internet cafes, libraries, or shared work computers where keyloggers or session hijacking risks exist.</li>
                <li><strong>Updated Contact Information:</strong> Ensure your registered email and phone number remain current and accessible. These are critical for withdrawal notifications, security alerts, and account recovery if needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Document Large Transactions:</strong> Keep personal records of all significant withdrawals including date, amount, destination account, and confirmation numbers. This documentation assists in resolving any payment delays or discrepancies.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Withdrawals:</strong> Rather than accumulating massive balances over long periods, consider regular monthly or quarterly withdrawals. This reduces the potential loss if security issues occur and helps you realize tangible value from your mining efforts regularly.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Troubleshooting Common Wallet Issues</h3>

        <h4>Balance Discrepancies</h4>
        <p>If your displayed balance seems incorrect or doesn't match your expectations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check your transaction history for all recent mining cycles—ensure each cycle you completed is properly logged with the correct earning amount for your level.</li>
            <li>Look for any withdrawals or transfers you may have forgotten about that reduced your balance.</li>
            <li>Refresh your browser or logout and login again to force a balance update—sometimes display caching causes temporary incorrect displays.</li>
            <li>Verify you're viewing "Available Balance" rather than "Total Balance" which might include pending or reserved amounts not yet accessible.</li>
            <li>If discrepancies persist after 24 hours, contact TAU support with your Member ID, the expected balance, the displayed balance, and relevant transaction dates for investigation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Missing Transactions</h4>
        <p>If a mining cycle completion or other transaction doesn't appear in your history:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wait 24 hours for transaction processing—some transactions have deliberate delays for security verification before appearing.</li>
            <li>Check that you actually completed the action you're looking for—for mining cycles, ensure you clicked MINE and saw the confirmation rather than assuming it happened.</li>
            <li>Review your transaction history filters—you may have an active date range or type filter hiding the transaction you're seeking.</li>
            <li>Verify you're logged into the correct account—if you have multiple TAU Member IDs or email addresses, ensure you're checking the right wallet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Locked or Inaccessible Wallet</h4>
        <p>If you cannot access your wallet due to login issues or account locks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the "Forgot Password" feature if password issues are preventing login—reset link will be sent to your registered email.</li>
            <li>Check your email for security alert messages that may explain why your account was locked and provide unlock procedures.</li>
            <li>If locked due to suspicious activity detection, follow the identity verification process provided in the lock notification to restore access.</li>
            <li>Contact TAU support with your Member ID, registered email, and explanation of the issue if standard unlock procedures don't resolve the problem within 48 hours.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11. Cash Withdrawal Process</h2>

        <h3>Converting Digital iKb to Spendable Cash</h3>
        <p>The cash withdrawal process represents the culmination of your KABIRU Mining efforts—the moment when your accumulated digital currency converts into real money you can spend, save, invest, or use to improve your family's quality of life. TAU Africa has designed a withdrawal system that balances accessibility (enabling members to regularly access their earnings), security (preventing fraud and protecting member accounts), and ecosystem stability (maintaining the value of iKb and ensuring sustainable liquidity). Understanding this process completely ensures smooth, successful withdrawals every time you need to convert your mined iKb into spendable local currency.</p>

        <h3>Withdrawal Eligibility and Requirements</h3>
        <p>Before you can request a cash withdrawal from KABIRU Mining, you must meet several eligibility criteria designed to ensure you're a legitimate, verified member and to protect the ecosystem from fraud:</p>

        <div class="info-box important">
            <div class="info-box-title">✅ Withdrawal Prerequisites</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Minimum Balance Requirement:</strong> You must have accumulated at least 1.0 iKb (equivalent to 100,000 KSH) in available balance before requesting a withdrawal. This minimum prevents excessive processing of tiny withdrawal amounts that would strain the system while providing meaningful payment amounts to members. Smaller balances can continue accumulating until reaching this threshold.</li>
                <li><strong>Linked TAU Member ID:</strong> Your KABIRU Mining account must be properly linked to a verified TAU Member ID from TAU Africa Main App. This linkage was completed during your initial setup and ensures your mining capacity is backed by validated real-world assets.</li>
                <li><strong>Complete Account Profile:</strong> Your account profile must include verified contact information (email and phone number), payment destination details (M-Pesa number, bank account, or other approved method), and accurate identity verification matching your TAU Africa registration.</li>
                <li><strong>Active Mining Status:</strong> Your account should be in good standing with no pending fraud investigations, policy violations, or administrative holds. Accounts flagged for suspicious activity may have withdrawals temporarily restricted pending investigation resolution.</li>
                <li><strong>Monthly Withdrawal Window:</strong> Withdrawals are processed on a monthly schedule, typically becoming available on the 1st of each month for earnings accumulated through the previous month. This monthly cadence allows TAU Foundation to manage liquidity efficiently while providing regular access to members' earned funds.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Withdrawal Schedule and Timing</h3>
        <p>KABIRU Mining operates on a monthly withdrawal cycle that provides predictable access to your earnings while enabling the TAU Foundation to manage the ecosystem's financial operations sustainably. Understanding this schedule helps you plan your withdrawal requests and set realistic expectations for payment receipt:</p>

        <h4>Monthly Withdrawal Windows</h4>
        <p>Withdrawal requests open on the 1st day of each calendar month and remain open for a request submission period (typically through the 5th of the month). During this window, you can submit requests for any eligible balance you've accumulated. Requests submitted during this window are processed in batches throughout the following weeks, with most members receiving payment within 3-7 business days of the window closing. If you miss the monthly withdrawal window, your balance remains securely stored in your wallet and can be withdrawn in the following month's window plus any additional earnings accumulated in the meantime.</p>

        <h4>Processing Timeline</h4>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Timeline Stage</th>
                <th>Typical Duration</th>
                <th>What Happens</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Withdrawal Request Submission</td>
                <td>1st-5th of month</td>
                <td>You submit withdrawal request specifying amount and payment method</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Request Verification</td>
                <td>1-2 business days</td>
                <td>TAU system verifies your identity, balance, and payment details</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Batch Processing Queue</td>
                <td>Varies by volume</td>
                <td>Your request joins the monthly processing queue with other members</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Payment Execution</td>
                <td>3-7 business days</td>
                <td>Funds transferred to your M-Pesa, bank account, or designated method</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Payment Confirmation</td>
                <td>Immediate upon transfer</td>
                <td>You receive SMS/email confirmation; check your mobile money/bank balance</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Example Timeline:</strong> If you submit a withdrawal request on January 3rd, you can typically expect to receive payment between January 8th and January 12th, though some payments may complete sooner or take slightly longer depending on payment method and processing volumes.</p>

        <h3>Step-by-Step Withdrawal Process</h3>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">1</span>
            <div class="step-title">Check Your Eligible Balance</div>
            <p>Login to KABIRU Mining and review your wallet dashboard. Confirm that your "Available Balance" meets or exceeds the 1.0 iKb minimum withdrawal requirement. Note the exact balance you wish to withdraw—you can withdraw your entire available balance or any portion thereof as long as the amount is at least 1.0 iKb.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">2</span>
            <div class="step-title">Navigate to Withdrawal Section</div>
            <p>Locate and click the "Withdraw" or "Cash Out" button, typically found prominently on your dashboard or within the wallet section. This opens the withdrawal request interface where you'll specify all details of your desired withdrawal.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">3</span>
            <div class="step-title">Specify Withdrawal Amount</div>
            <p>Enter the amount you wish to withdraw in iKb. The interface typically shows the iKb amount and automatically calculates and displays the equivalent KSH value based on the standard 1 iKb = 100,000 KSH conversion rate. For example, entering "2.5 iKb" automatically shows you'll receive "250,000 KSH" (before any applicable fees). Consider leaving a small balance in your wallet rather than withdrawing everything—this maintains your active account status and provides immediate funds for any ecosystem transactions you might want to make.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">4</span>
            <div class="step-title">Select Payment Method</div>
            <p>Choose how you want to receive your cash payment. TAU Africa typically supports multiple payment methods to accommodate member preferences and regional availability:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mobile Money:</strong> M-Pesa (Kenya), Airtel Money (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania), MTN Mobile Money (Uganda, Rwanda), or Tigo Pesa (Tanzania). This is the fastest, most convenient option for most members in East Africa, with payments typically received within 24-48 hours of processing. Specify your registered mobile money phone number.</li>
                <li><strong>Bank Transfer:</strong> Direct deposit to your bank account. Requires your bank name, account number, and account name. Processing takes slightly longer (3-5 business days) but works well for larger withdrawals or members who prefer banking channels.</li>
                <li><strong>Agent Pickup (if available):</strong> Some regions may offer cash pickup through TAU-authorized agents or partner locations. Check availability in your area and specify your preferred pickup location if using this method.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">5</span>
            <div class="step-title">Review Fees and Final Amount</div>
            <p>The withdrawal interface displays any applicable processing fees and the final net amount you'll receive. TAU Africa strives to minimize fees to maximize member value, but small processing fees may apply to cover mobile money transaction costs, bank transfer fees, or administrative processing. Review this information carefully to ensure the final amount meets your expectations before proceeding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">6</span>
            <div class="step-title">Confirm Payment Details</div>
            <p>Carefully verify all payment information before submitting your request. Double-check that your mobile money number or bank account details are entered correctly—errors in payment information cause processing delays and may result in failed payments requiring resubmission. Ensure the recipient name matches your registered TAU Africa account name to prevent fraud detection blocks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">7</span>
            <div class="step-title">Submit Withdrawal Request</div>
            <p>Click "Submit Withdrawal Request" or "Process Withdrawal" button. You may be required to complete additional verification at this point including entering an SMS code sent to your registered phone number, clicking an email confirmation link, or answering security questions. Complete these verification steps promptly as they time out after a few minutes, requiring resubmission if expired.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">8</span>
            <div class="step-title">Receive Confirmation</div>
            <p>Upon successful submission, you'll see an on-screen confirmation with a unique transaction reference number. This reference number is critical—save it by taking a screenshot, writing it down, or saving the confirmation email that's sent to your registered address. This number is essential for tracking your withdrawal status or resolving any issues that might arise during processing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">9</span>
            <div class="step-title">Monitor Processing Status</div>
            <p>Your withdrawal request status is typically visible in your transaction history within the KABIRU Mining dashboard. Check periodically to see status updates such as "Pending Verification," "Verified and Queued for Processing," "Processing Payment," "Payment Sent," or "Completed." You'll also receive email updates at key processing stages keeping you informed of progress without requiring constant dashboard checking.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">10</span>
            <div class="step-title">Receive Payment</div>
            <p>When your payment is executed, you'll receive immediate notification via SMS and email confirming the payment with details including the amount sent, the payment method used, and the transaction reference. Check your mobile money account balance (for M-Pesa/Airtel Money/MTN Mobile Money) or bank account (for bank transfers) to confirm receipt. The payment will typically show the sender as "TAU Africa" or "KABIRU Mining" or a similar recognizable identifier.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-box warning">
            <div class="info-box-title">⚠️ Important Withdrawal Considerations</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Withdrawal Limits:</strong> While there is a minimum withdrawal amount (1.0 iKb), there may also be maximum limits per transaction or per month to maintain ecosystem stability. Check current limits in the withdrawal interface or contact support if planning very large withdrawals.</li>
                <li><strong>Tax Implications:</strong> Depending on your country's tax laws, income earned through KABIRU Mining may be taxable. TAU Africa provides transaction records for your use in tax preparation, but ultimate tax compliance responsibility rests with individual members. Consult local tax professionals regarding your obligations.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment Method Availability:</strong> Supported payment methods vary by country and region. If your preferred method isn't available, consider alternative methods or contact TAU support to request addition of specific payment channels in your region.</li>
                <li><strong>Processing Delays:</strong> While typical processing is 3-7 business days, unusual circumstances like high withdrawal volumes during monthly windows, banking holidays, technical issues with payment providers, or enhanced security reviews for large amounts may extend processing times. Be patient and use your transaction reference number to check status before contacting support.</li>
                <li><strong>Failed Payments:</strong> If a payment fails due to incorrect details, closed accounts, or technical issues, your iKb balance is automatically restored to your wallet and you can resubmit a corrected withdrawal request. Check your email for failure notification explaining the issue and resolution steps.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Withdrawal Fee Structure</h3>
        <p>TAU Africa maintains transparent, minimal fee structures for withdrawals to ensure members receive maximum value from their mining efforts while covering necessary operational costs:</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Payment Method</th>
                <th>Typical Fee</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>M-Pesa</td>
                <td>1-2% or fixed amount</td>
                <td>Covers mobile money transaction fees; varies by amount</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Bank Transfer (Local)</td>
                <td>Fixed amount ~100-500 KSH</td>
                <td>Standard banking fees; more economical for larger withdrawals</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Other Mobile Money</td>
                <td>Similar to M-Pesa</td>
                <td>Varies by provider and region</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p><em>Note: Fee structures may change based on payment provider fee adjustments or TAU Africa policy updates. Current fees are always displayed in the withdrawal interface before you submit your request.</em></p>

        <h3>Maximizing Your Withdrawal Efficiency</h3>

        <div class="info-box tip">
            <div class="info-box-title">💡 Withdrawal Strategy Tips</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Batch Smaller Earnings:</strong> Rather than withdrawing small amounts monthly, Level 1 miners might consider accumulating several months' earnings before withdrawing to reduce the proportional impact of fixed fees and processing costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Time Your Requests:</strong> Submit withdrawal requests early in the monthly window (1st-2nd of the month) to receive processing priority and typically faster payment compared to requests submitted late in the window.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintain Accurate Records:</strong> Keep personal records of all withdrawals including dates, amounts, payment methods, and confirmation numbers for your own financial tracking and potential tax preparation needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Diversify Payment Methods:</strong> Register multiple payment methods in your account profile so you have alternatives if one method experiences technical issues or delays.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider Reinvestment:</strong> Before withdrawing all accumulated iKb, consider whether using some earnings within the TAU ecosystem (TAU Marketplace purchases, TAU Tube content promotion) might provide value while supporting ecosystem growth and your own network development.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>12. Lockup & Reserve Options</h2>

        <h3>Understanding Advanced Earning Mechanisms</h3>
        <p>Beyond standard daily mining, KABIRU Mining may offer advanced earning mechanisms designed to reward long-term commitment to the ecosystem and provide additional liquidity management tools. These optional programs allow members to earn enhanced returns by committing portions of their iKb balance to time-locked programs or ecosystem reserves. While not required for standard mining operations, these programs can significantly boost earnings for members with strategic long-term perspectives and sufficient cash flow to temporarily reduce liquid access to portions of their balance.</p>

        <h3>Lockup Staking Programs</h3>
        <p>Lockup staking programs enable you to commit specific amounts of iKb for predetermined time periods in exchange for bonus rewards. This mechanism serves multiple purposes within the TAU ecosystem including reducing circulating supply temporarily to maintain value stability, rewarding committed members who demonstrate long-term faith in the ecosystem, providing predictable liquidity planning for TAU Foundation, and encouraging wealth accumulation rather than immediate consumption. When lockup programs are available, they typically offer several tier options:</p>

        <h4>Typical Lockup Tiers</h4>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Lockup Period</th>
                <th>Bonus Rate</th>
                <th>Total Return</th>
                <th>Best For</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3 Months</td>
                <td>+5% bonus</td>
                <td>Original + 5%</td>
                <td>Short-term commitment, testing the program</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>6 Months</td>
                <td>+12% bonus</td>
                <td>Original + 12%</td>
                <td>Medium-term planning, meaningful bonus</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>12 Months</td>
                <td>+25% bonus</td>
                <td>Original + 25%</td>
                <td>Long-term investors, maximum returns</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>24 Months</td>
                <td>+60% bonus</td>
                <td>Original + 60%</td>
                <td>Generational wealth building, committed members</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Example Calculation:</strong> If you lock 10 iKb for 12 months at 25% bonus, you'll receive 12.5 iKb after the year completes (your original 10 iKb plus 2.5 iKb bonus). In KSH terms, that's 1,000,000 KSH becoming 1,250,000 KSH—a 250,000 KSH gain for simply committing to keep the funds in the ecosystem for one year.</p>

        <h3>How Lockup Programs Work</h3>
        <p>Participating in lockup staking is straightforward but requires careful consideration before committing funds:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Review Available Programs:</strong> Check your KABIRU Mining dashboard for active lockup offerings. These may be permanent programs or limited-time special offers with enhanced rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Assess Your Liquidity Needs:</strong> Only lock iKb you won't need during the lockup period. Consider your monthly expenses, emergency fund needs, and other financial obligations before committing.</li>
            <li><strong>Select Lockup Tier:</strong> Choose the time period and bonus rate that aligns with your financial goals and liquidity situation.</li>
            <li><strong>Specify Lock Amount:</strong> Enter the iKb amount you wish to lock. Most programs have minimums (often 1-5 iKb) but no maximums, allowing you to lock substantial balances if desired.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm Terms:</strong> Carefully review the complete terms including lockup duration, bonus rate, early withdrawal penalties (if any), and maturity date when funds plus bonus will be released.</li>
            <li><strong>Submit Lockup:</strong> Confirm your lockup commitment. The specified iKb amount immediately moves from your "Available Balance" to "Locked Balance" in your wallet.</li>
            <li><strong>Wait for Maturity:</strong> Your locked iKb remains untouchable during the commitment period. You can continue mining and earning new iKb normally during this time.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Release:</strong> On the maturity date, your original locked amount plus the bonus returns to your available balance automatically, ready for withdrawal or re-locking if desired.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="info-box warning">
            <div class="info-box-title">⚠️ Lockup Important Considerations</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Early Access:</strong> Locked iKb cannot be accessed before the maturity date under normal circumstances. Even emergencies typically don't override lockup commitments, so only lock funds you can genuinely live without for the entire period.</li>
                <li><strong>Early Withdrawal Penalties:</strong> If the program permits early withdrawal at all, substantial penalties usually apply (often forfeiting all bonus earnings plus a percentage of principal). This discourages breaking commitments and maintains program integrity.</li>
                <li><strong>Opportunity Cost:</strong> While locked iKb earns bonus rates, you lose the flexibility to use those funds for potentially higher-return opportunities that might arise (business investments, emergency bargains, ecosystem opportunities). Balance lockup benefits against maintaining sufficient liquid reserves.</li>
                <li><strong>Program Changes:</strong> Lockup terms agreed upon at commitment initiation remain fixed for that specific lockup, even if program rates change later. This protects you from negative changes but also means you can't claim better rates introduced after your lock begins.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Reserve Fund Programs</h3>
        <p>Reserve programs differ from lockups by maintaining more flexibility while still earning bonuses. In reserve programs, you commit iKb to an ecosystem reserve fund that supports TAU Foundation operations but can typically access your reserves with advance notice (often 30-90 days). Reserve programs offer lower bonus rates than equivalent lockup periods but provide greater liquidity flexibility, making them suitable for members wanting enhanced returns without complete illiquidity.</p>

        <h3>Strategic Use of Advanced Programs</h3>
        <div class="info-box tip">
            <div class="info-box-title">💡 Optimization Strategies</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ladder Your Lockups:</strong> Rather than locking everything at once, create a ladder of multiple lockups with staggered maturity dates. For example, lock 2 iKb for 3 months, 2 iKb for 6 months, and 2 iKb for 12 months. This provides periodic liquidity as each lockup matures while maximizing overall bonus earnings.</li>
                <li><strong>Reinvest Matured Bonuses:</strong> When a lockup matures and returns original plus bonus, immediately re-lock the entire amount (original + bonus) for compounding effects. Over multiple cycles, this compounding significantly amplifies returns.</li>
                <li><strong>Balance Liquid and Locked:</strong> Maintain sufficient available balance to meet monthly needs and handle emergencies (suggest 3-6 months of typical withdrawals) while locking longer-term accumulations. This provides both immediate access to funds and enhanced long-term growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitor Mining Income:</strong> Continue consistent daily mining while funds are locked. Your ongoing mining production provides new liquid funds regularly even while locked balances remain committed, creating dual income streams.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>13. Referral System</h2>

        <h3>Growing the Ecosystem Through Referrals</h3>
        <p>The TAU Africa Referral Program transforms every member into a potential ecosystem ambassador, rewarding you for introducing new members who bring additional validated assets into the system. This win-win mechanism helps TAU grow its asset pool and member base while providing existing members with substantial bonus earning opportunities beyond standard mining. Successful referrers can earn amounts exceeding their mining production through strategic network building.</p>

        <h3>How Referrals Work</h3>
        <p>The referral process begins with your unique referral code or link, automatically generated when you create your KABIRU Mining account. This code is tied to your Member ID, ensuring you receive credit for anyone who uses it during registration. When someone uses your referral code or link to register in TAU Africa Main App, declares and validates assets meeting the minimum threshold (typically 1,000,000 KSH), and begins mining in KABIRU, you earn referral bonuses at multiple stages of their journey.</p>

        <h3>Referral Reward Structure</h3>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Milestone</th>
                <th>Your Bonus</th>

            <tr>
                <td>First Declaration Validated</td>
                <td>100 iKbp (10 KSH equivalent)</td>
                <td>Your referral's first asset declaration is approved</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mining Qualification</td>
                <td>0.05 iKb (5,000 KSH)</td>

            <tr>
                <td>30-Day Active Mining</td>
                <td>0.25 iKb (25,000 KSH)</td>
                <td>Your referral mines consistently for 30 consecutive days</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Level 2 Upgrade</td>
                <td>0.5 iKb (50,000 KSH)</td>
                <td>Your referral upgrades to Level 2 mining (6M+ KSH validated)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Level 3 Upgrade</td>
                <td>1.0 iKb (100,000 KSH)</td>
                <td>Your referral upgrades to Level 3 mining (12M+ KSH validated)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Total Potential Per Referral:</strong> If you refer someone who eventually reaches Level 3 mining status, you can earn approximately 1.91 iKb (191,000 KSH) from that single referral across all milestones. Multiply this by multiple successful referrals and the earning potential becomes substantial.</p>

        <h3>Finding Your Referral Code and Link</h3>
        <p>Access your unique referral credentials through your KABIRU Mining dashboard:</p>
        <ol>

            <li>Navigate to "Referrals" section or look for "My Referral Code" on your dashboard</li>
            <li>Find your unique referral code (typically format: REFXXXXXX where X's are your unique numbers)</li>
            <li>Copy your custom referral link (format: https://magero1985.github.io/Tau-Africa/?ref=YOURCODE)</li>
            <li>Share these credentials with potential members</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Effective Referral Strategies</h3>
        <div class="info-box tip">
            <div class="info-box-title">💡 Maximize Your Referral Success</div>
            <p><strong>Target the Right Prospects:</strong> Focus referral efforts on individuals likely to qualify for and succeed in KABIRU Mining:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Property Owners:</strong> People who own land, homes, or commercial property already meet significant portions of the 1M KSH minimum threshold.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Operators:</strong> Entrepreneurs running even small businesses often have 1M+ KSH in combined business assets and personal property.</li>
                <li><strong>Professionals:</strong> Certified professionals (doctors, lawyers, engineers, teachers) can declare skill value plus any property they own.</li>
                <li><strong>Farmers:</strong> Agricultural landowners with equipment and livestock often have substantial declarable value.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Educate Your Referrals:</strong> Simply sharing a link isn't enough. Help your referrals succeed by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explaining the Declaration Mining concept and how it differs from traditional cryptocurrency</li>
                <li>Walking them through what assets they can declare (many people don't realize skills and expertise count)</li>
                <li>Sharing this user manual with them for comprehensive guidance</li>
                <li>Offering to answer questions during their registration and validation process</li>
                <li>Encouraging them to declare all possible assets to reach higher mining levels</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Follow Up and Support:</strong> Your referral bonuses depend on your referrals' success, so invest in their success:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check in after they register to ensure they're progressing through asset declaration</li>
                <li>Remind them to respond promptly to validation requests from community validators</li>
                <li>Celebrate when they receive validation approval and qualify for mining</li>
                <li>Encourage consistent daily mining to trigger your 30-day milestone bonus</li>
                <li>Share mining tips and ecosystem news to keep them engaged</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Tracking Your Referrals</h3>
        <p>Your KABIRU dashboard provides comprehensive referral tracking including total referrals registered using your code, active referrals currently mining, milestone progress for each referral showing which bonuses you've earned and which are pending, total referral earnings accumulated to date, and individual referral details if you want to follow up with specific people you've referred. This transparency helps you understand your referral income and identify which referrals might need encouragement to reach the next milestone.</p>

        <h3>Multi-Level Referral Opportunities</h3>
        <p>Some TAU ecosystem applications implement multi-level referral programs where you earn smaller bonuses on your referrals' referrals (your second-level network). While KABIRU Mining primarily focuses on direct referrals, engaging with the broader TAU ecosystem can multiply your referral earning potential across multiple platforms and levels.</p>

        <h2>14. Security & Best Practices</h2>

        <h3>Protecting Your KABIRU Mining Account</h3>
        <p>Your KABIRU Mining account represents real economic value—your accumulated iKb balance translates directly to spendable cash. Implementing robust security practices protects your earnings from unauthorized access, theft, or fraud while ensuring uninterrupted mining operations and smooth withdrawals.</p>

        <h3>Account Security Essentials</h3>

        <h4>Password Management</h4>
        <div class="info-box important">
            <div class="info-box-title">🔐 Creating Unbreakable Passwords</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Length Matters Most:</strong> Use minimum 12 characters; 16+ is ideal. Longer passwords exponentially increase hacking difficulty.</li>
                <li><strong>Complexity Requirements:</strong> Include uppercase letters (A-Z), lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and special characters (!@#$%^&*)</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Common Patterns:</strong> Don't use dictionary words, personal information (names, birthdays), sequential patterns (123456, abcdef), or keyboard patterns (qwerty, asdfgh)</li>
                <li><strong>Unique Per Account:</strong> Never reuse passwords across accounts. If one account is compromised, unique passwords prevent cascade breaches.</li>
                <li><strong>Password Managers:</strong> Consider using reputable password managers (LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden) to generate and store complex passwords securely</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Strong Password Example:</strong> <span class="code">TauMining#2024@Sovereign!9K</span></p>
            <p><strong>Weak Password Example:</strong> <span class="code">john1985</span> or <span class="code">password123</span></p>
        </div>

        <h4>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h4>
        <p>When available, enable two-factor authentication on your KABIRU account. This adds a second verification step beyond your password, typically requiring:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SMS Codes:</strong> One-time codes sent to your registered phone number</li>
            <li><strong>Email Verification:</strong> Confirmation links sent to your registered email</li>
            <li><strong>Authenticator Apps:</strong> Time-based codes from apps like Google Authenticator or Authy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even if someone steals your password, they cannot access your account without the second authentication factor you control.</p>

        <h4>Device Security</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure Your Devices:</strong> Use PIN, password, fingerprint, or face recognition to lock your phone, tablet, and computer. If someone gains physical access to unlocked devices, they may access your logged-in accounts.</li>
            <li><strong>Update Regularly:</strong> Keep your operating system, browser, and security software updated. Updates often patch security vulnerabilities hackers exploit.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Public WiFi for Sensitive Operations:</strong> Public networks in cafes, airports, or hotels are vulnerable to eavesdropping. Use mobile data or trusted home/office networks when accessing KABIRU, especially for withdrawals.</li>
            <li><strong>Trusted Devices Only:</strong> Never login to KABIRU Mining on shared computers, internet cafe machines, or others' devices. These may have keyloggers or session hijacking software installed.</li>
        </ul>

                <li><strong>Phishing Emails:</strong> Fake emails pretending to be from TAU Africa requesting your password, Member ID, or account details. TAU NEVER asks for passwords via email.</li>
                <li><strong>Fake Websites:</strong> Copycat sites mimicking KABIRU Mining login pages to steal credentials. Always verify you're on the correct URL before entering information.</li>
                <li><strong>"Too Good to Be True" Offers:</strong> Messages promising instant iKb bonuses, multiplication schemes, or guaranteed returns for sending iKb to someone. These are always scams.</li>
                <li><strong>Impersonators:</strong> People claiming to be TAU staff, administrators, or validators asking for payments, account access, or sensitive information.</li>
                <li><strong>Urgent Pressure Tactics:</strong> Messages claiming your account will be suspended, deactivated, or penalized unless you take immediate action including providing credentials.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Protection Rules:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Never share your password with anyone for any reason—legitimate TAU staff never need it</li>
                <li>Verify email sender addresses carefully (look for misspellings in domain names)</li>
                <li>Access KABIRU only through official URLs you've personally verified and bookmarked</li>
                <li>Be skeptical of unsolicited contact, even if it appears official</li>
                <li>When in doubt, contact TAU support directly through official channels before taking any action</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Safe Mining Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mine Consistently:</strong> Establish a daily routine and stick to it. Irregular patterns can sometimes trigger security reviews if they deviate dramatically from your typical behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor Your Balance:</strong> Check your balance and transaction history regularly (at least weekly). Early detection of unauthorized activity enables faster resolution.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Your Recovery Options:</strong> Keep your registered email and phone number current and secure. These are essential for password resets and account recovery.</li>
            <li><strong>Document Everything:</strong> Save confirmation emails, take screenshots of important transactions, and keep records of your Member ID and registration details in secure storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Secure Networks:</strong> When possible, mine from trusted networks (home WiFi, mobile data from your phone). Avoid mining through VPNs or proxy services that might appear suspicious to security systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What to Do If Compromised</h3>
        <p>If you suspect unauthorized access to your account:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Change Password Immediately:</strong> Use a different device if possible, in case your primary device is compromised.</li>
            <li><strong>Check Transaction History:</strong> Review all recent activity for unauthorized transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact TAU Support Urgently:</strong> Email grouptauafrica@gmail.com with subject "URGENT: Account Security Issue" including your Member ID and description of the problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Request Account Lock:</strong> If you see unauthorized transactions, request immediate account lock to prevent further damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Document the Incident:</strong> Take screenshots of suspicious transactions or activity for investigation purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Scan Your Devices:</strong> Run comprehensive antivirus/malware scans on all devices you use to access KABIRU.</li>
        </ol>
