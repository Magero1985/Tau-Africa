        <h2>1. Introduction to KABIRU Mining</h2>

        <div class="info-box important">
            <div class="info-box-title">🎯 Our Vision</div>
            <p>To achieve economic independence through the power of Declaration. We are not just mining currency; we are building sovereignty structures for families, communities, and entire generations. KABIRU Mining represents a fundamental shift in how wealth is created, validated, and distributed across the African continent and beyond.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What is KABIRU (iKb)?</h3>
        <p>KABIRU is a revolutionary digital asset that represents real-world value in the TAU Africa Ecosystem. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that require expensive mining equipment costing thousands of dollars and consume massive amounts of electricity, KABIRU uses an innovative system called <strong>Declaration Mining</strong>. This groundbreaking approach allows you to mine digital currency based on the real-world assets and values you declare and have validated through our community-driven verification process.</p>

        <h3>Key Features of KABIRU Mining</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Value-Based Mining:</strong> Your mining capacity is directly proportional to the total value of assets you have declared and had validated in the TAU Africa Main App. This includes land, property, businesses, skills, services, and intellectual property.</li>
            <li><strong>No Hardware Requirements:</strong> Mine directly from your smartphone, tablet, or computer without purchasing specialized equipment. All you need is an internet connection and validated real-world assets.</li>
            <li><strong>Real Economic Value:</strong> 1 iKb equals 100,000 units of local currency (KSH, UGX, TSH, etc.), providing stable, predictable value backed by actual assets in the ecosystem.</li>
            <li><strong>Tiered Mining System:</strong> Three distinct mining levels (Basic, Community, and Sovereign) based on your total declared value, ensuring fair rewards relative to your economic contribution.</li>
            <li><strong>24-Hour Active Cycles:</strong> Daily participation is rewarded through simple button-click activation, making mining accessible to everyone regardless of technical expertise.</li>
            <li><strong>Monthly Cash Withdrawals:</strong> Convert your earned iKb to local currency every 30 days through secure, verified withdrawal processes via mobile money or bank transfer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Who Can Benefit from KABIRU Mining?</h3>
        <p>KABIRU Mining is designed to be inclusive and accessible to a wide range of participants in the TAU Africa Ecosystem. The system recognizes different types of value contributors and rewards them proportionally. Here's how different groups can benefit from Declaration Mining:</p>

        <h4>Landowners and Property Holders</h4>
        <p>If you own land, residential property, commercial buildings, or any real estate, you can declare these assets in the TAU Africa Main App. Once validated by the community and administrators, your property value contributes to your mining capacity. Even small plots of land or modest homes can help you reach the minimum threshold for Level 1 mining (1 million KSH in declared value).</p>

        <h4>Business Owners and Entrepreneurs</h4>
        <p>Operating businesses of any size—from small shops and kiosks to large enterprises—can be declared and validated. Your business assets, inventory, intellectual property, and operational capacity all contribute to your total declared value, potentially qualifying you for higher mining levels and greater daily iKb production.</p>

        <h4>Skilled Professionals and Service Providers</h4>
        <p>Your professional skills, certifications, education, and service capacity have real economic value that can be declared. Teachers, consultants, craftspeople, healthcare workers, IT professionals, and any other skilled individuals can monetize their expertise through the mining system once their skills are validated by the community.</p>

        <h4>Farmers and Agricultural Producers</h4>
        <p>Agricultural land, livestock, farming equipment, and production capacity represent significant value that often goes unrecognized by traditional banking systems. KABIRU Mining allows farmers to leverage their agricultural assets for daily digital currency production.</p>

        <h4>Creative Professionals and Artists</h4>
        <p>Intellectual property, creative works, patents, copyrights, and artistic output can be declared as valuable assets. Musicians, writers, designers, and other creatives can transform their portfolio into mining capacity.</p>

        <h2>2. Declaration Mining Concept</h2>

        <h3>Understanding the Four-Step Process</h3>
        <p>Declaration Mining is built on a transparent, community-driven validation system that ensures every miner's capacity is backed by real, verifiable assets. The process consists of four essential stages that transform your real-world wealth into digital mining power.</p>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">1</span>
            <div class="step-title">Declare Your Values</div>
            <p>In the TAU Africa Main App (accessible at https://magero1985.github.io/Tau-Africa/), you begin by declaring your real-world assets. This comprehensive declaration process captures the full spectrum of your economic value across multiple categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Assets:</strong> Land parcels with title deeds, residential properties (houses, apartments), commercial buildings, vehicles (cars, motorcycles, trucks), agricultural equipment, machinery, and tools. Each physical asset should be documented with relevant proof of ownership.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Assets:</strong> Operating businesses with business registration certificates, inventory and stock, equipment and furniture, intellectual property (patents, trademarks, copyrights), digital assets, and business goodwill. Business declarations should include operational details and revenue information.</li>
                <li><strong>Skills and Services:</strong> Professional skills backed by certifications (medical degrees, engineering licenses, teaching credentials), trade skills (carpentry, plumbing, electrical work), consulting expertise, teaching and training capacity, and specialized knowledge in specific domains. Service capacity declarations should detail your hourly rates and expertise level.</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge Assets:</strong> Educational qualifications, professional experience and track record, specialized expertise in niche areas, research and publications, mentorship capacity, and advisory services. Knowledge declarations help establish your value as a thought leader or consultant.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">2</span>
            <div class="step-title">Three-Stage Validation</div>
            <p>Your declarations undergo rigorous verification through a multi-layered validation process designed to ensure authenticity, accuracy, and community trust. This three-stage system protects the integrity of the entire KABIRU ecosystem:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Internal System Review (Automated):</strong> The TAU system performs initial checks for completeness, consistency, and obvious red flags. This includes verifying that all required fields are filled, documentation is uploaded, declared values fall within reasonable ranges for the asset type, and there are no duplicate declarations in the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecosystem Community Review:</strong> Fellow TAU members who serve as community validators examine your declarations. These validators check for authenticity by reviewing supporting documents, assess whether declared values are realistic based on market rates, verify that assets genuinely exist (through photos, documents, or site visits), and provide feedback or request additional information if needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Administrative Final Approval:</strong> TAU administrators perform the final validation, conducting comprehensive review of all documentation, cross-referencing with external databases where possible, ensuring compliance with TAU policies and local regulations, and making the final determination on value assignment. Once administrators approve, your declared value is locked into your mining capacity.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Validation Timeline:</strong> The complete validation process typically takes 3 to 7 business days from initial declaration to final approval. Simple declarations with clear documentation may be approved faster, while complex declarations involving multiple assets or requiring additional verification may take the full seven days. You will receive email notifications at each stage of the validation process.</p>

            <div class="step-title">Value Bank Activation</div>
            <p>Once your declarations are validated and approved, your total value (calculated in KSH equivalent) is recorded in your Value Bank within the TAU Africa Main App. This Value Bank serves as the foundation for your mining capacity in KABIRU. The system automatically assigns you to one of three mining levels based on your total validated value:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Level 1 - Basic Miner:</strong> For total validated values between 1,000,000 and 5,999,999 KSH. This level allows you to mine 0.005 iKb per day, which equals 500 KSH per day or approximately 15,000 KSH per month with consistent mining.</li>
                <li><strong>Level 2 - Community Miner:</strong> For total validated values between 6,000,000 and 11,999,999 KSH. This level doubles your mining capacity to 0.01 iKb per day, which equals 1,000 KSH per day or approximately 30,000 KSH per month with consistent mining.</li>
                <li><strong>Level 3 - Sovereign Miner:</strong> For total validated values of 12,000,000 KSH and above. This premium level provides the highest mining rate of 0.1 iKb per day, which equals 10,000 KSH per day or approximately 300,000 KSH per month with consistent mining.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your mining level is automatically updated whenever you add and validate additional assets. There is no limit to how high your mining level can grow as you continue to declare and validate more value within the ecosystem.</p>

            <div class="step-title">Begin Mining Operations</div>
            <p>With your Value Bank activated and mining level assigned, you are ready to begin mining KABIRU currency. Login to the KABIRU Mining App at https://magero1985.github.io/Tau-Africa/Kabiru-Mining-Portal/ and click the prominent <strong>MINE</strong> button to start your first 24-hour mining cycle. Your iKb accumulates automatically over the next 24 hours based on your mining level, with earnings distributed evenly across the cycle (hourly accumulation). You must return within 24 hours to click the MINE button again to start your next cycle—this active participation requirement ensures miners remain engaged with the ecosystem.</p>

        <div class="info-box tip">
            <div class="info-box-title">💡 Why This System Creates Real Value</div>
            <p>Declaration Mining succeeds where many cryptocurrency systems fail because it is backed by real, tangible value rather than speculation. Consider these fundamental principles that make KABIRU sustainable:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Asset-Backed Currency:</strong> Your mining capacity is directly proportional to verified real-world assets. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, where mining creates value from computational work, KABIRU mining distributes value based on what you already own. This means every iKb mined represents a fraction of the total asset pool in the TAU ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Validation Builds Trust:</strong> The three-stage validation process creates multiple layers of verification. Community validators who live in your region can verify the existence of land or businesses. Administrators cross-reference official records. This distributed validation system makes fraud extremely difficult and builds confidence across the entire network.</li>
                <li><strong>Stable Value Maintenance:</strong> The 1 iKb = 100,000 KSH exchange rate is maintained through careful ecosystem management. The total amount of iKb that can be mined is proportional to the total validated asset pool. As more assets are declared and validated, more mining capacity becomes available, but always in proportion to real value added to the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Controlled Withdrawals:</strong> Monthly withdrawal limits and processing periods allow the TAU Foundation to manage liquidity without compromising the stability of iKb value. This prevents bank-run scenarios that have collapsed other digital currency projects.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Incentive Alignment:</strong> Miners are incentivized to declare honest values because over-declaration leads to rejection during validation, wasting time. Under-declaration leaves mining capacity on the table. The system naturally encourages accurate declarations that reflect true market value.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Prerequisites for KABIRU Mining</h3>
        <p>Before you can begin mining operations in KABIRU, you must complete several essential prerequisites within the TAU Africa ecosystem. These requirements ensure that every miner has legitimate, validated assets backing their mining capacity and maintains the integrity of the entire system.</p>

        <div class="info-box important">
            <div class="info-box-title">✅ Essential Requirements Checklist</div>
            <p>You MUST complete ALL of the following steps before you can start mining KABIRU currency:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Submit Declarations in TAU Africa Main App:</strong> Log into https://magero1985.github.io/Tau-Africa/ and add these new asset declarations through the value declaration interface. Be thorough and accurate in your descriptions—overvaluation will be caught during validation and may delay approval, while undervaluation leaves mining capacity on the table.</li>
                <li><strong>Complete Validation Process:</strong> Your new declarations will go through the same three-stage validation (Internal Review, Community Validation, Administrative Approval) that took three to seven business days for your initial declarations. Monitor your email for validation updates and respond promptly to any requests for additional information or clarification from validators.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic Level Upgrade:</strong> Once your new declarations are validated and approved, your total validated value in TAU Africa automatically updates. The KABIRU Mining system continuously synchronizes with your TAU Africa Value Bank. The moment your total crosses into a new tier—for example, when you reach 6,000,000 KSH total value moving from Level 1 to Level 2, or 12,000,000 KSH moving to Level 3—your mining level upgrades automatically. You don't need to take any manual action in KABIRU Mining.</li>
                <li><strong>Immediate Rate Adjustment:</strong> Your new, higher mining rate takes effect with your very next mining cycle. If you're mid-cycle when the upgrade happens, you'll finish that cycle at your old rate, but clicking MINE again will start a cycle at your new, upgraded rate. You'll receive an email notification confirming your level upgrade and new daily production rate.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Practical Example of Upgrade Process:</strong> Sarah is currently a Level 1 miner with 4,000,000 KSH in validated assets (land worth 2,500,000 KSH and skills worth 1,500,000 KSH). She realizes she owns a vehicle worth 1,800,000 KSH and business equipment worth 1,200,000 KSH that she hasn't declared. She prepares photos and receipts for these assets and submits declarations in TAU Africa. After five days, her new declarations are validated. Her total value is now 7,000,000 KSH (4M + 1.8M + 1.2M), automatically upgrading her to Level 2. Her daily mining rate instantly doubles from 0.005 iKb to 0.01 iKb, doubling her earning potential from 15,000 KSH per month to 30,000 KSH per month.</p>

        <h2>5. Understanding Mining Levels</h2>

        <h3>The Three-Tier System Explained</h3>
        <p>KABIRU Mining employs a three-tier structure that directly correlates your mining capacity with your economic contribution to the TAU ecosystem. This tiered approach ensures fairness by rewarding members proportionally to their validated real-world assets while maintaining accessibility for members at all economic levels. The system recognizes that value comes in many forms—from the small landowner with a modest plot to the large business owner with extensive operations—and provides appropriate mining capacity for each.</p>

        </table>

        <p><strong>Who This Level Serves:</strong> Level 1 is designed for new members joining the TAU ecosystem, individuals with modest asset portfolios focused primarily on skills or small property holdings, young professionals building their wealth, and members in the process of declaring and validating additional assets. This entry-level mining rate ensures that everyone with minimum qualifying assets can participate in the KABIRU economy and benefit from declaration mining, regardless of their current economic position.</p>

        <p><strong>Real-World Applications of Level 1 Earnings:</strong> A monthly income of 15,000 KSH from Level 1 mining can cover significant household expenses in many African contexts. This amount can pay for children's school fees at primary level, contribute substantially to monthly food budgets for small families, cover transportation costs for commuting to work, provide emergency savings buffer, or fund small business inventory purchases. For many Level 1 miners, these earnings represent meaningful supplementary income that improves quality of life and provides financial flexibility.</p>

        <p><strong>Who This Level Serves:</strong> Level 2 miners typically include established professionals with property ownership, small to medium business owners with operational enterprises, property owners with residential or commercial real estate, individuals who have successfully combined multiple asset categories (land + business + skills), and members who have deliberately declared and validated diverse asset portfolios to reach this tier.</p>

        <p><strong>Economic Impact of Level 2 Earnings:</strong> Monthly earnings of 30,000 KSH represent significant additional income in most African economies. This amount can cover rent payments for family housing in urban areas, pay for secondary school fees for multiple children, fund small business expansion or inventory investment, provide savings for major household purchases (furniture, appliances), cover healthcare costs including insurance premiums, or contribute substantially to home loan payments. For many Level 2 miners, these earnings represent the difference between financial stability and financial stress.</p>

        <p><strong>Who This Level Serves:</strong> Level 3 miners represent the highest tier of the KABIRU ecosystem and typically include large landowners with multiple properties or extensive acreage, established business owners with significant operations and assets, professionals with substantial real estate and investment portfolios, individuals who have built comprehensive asset declarations across multiple categories, and family estates or multi-generational wealth that has been properly declared and validated.</p>

        <p><strong>Transformative Potential of Level 3 Earnings:</strong> Monthly earnings of 300,000 KSH from Level 3 mining represent substantial income by any standard. This amount exceeds average middle-class salaries in many African countries and can fund university education for multiple children, make significant real estate investments or down payments, support business expansion including hiring employees, provide comprehensive healthcare including private insurance, build long-term investment portfolios, or support multiple family members across generations. Annual earnings of 3,650,000 KSH create genuine wealth-building opportunities and can transform the economic trajectory of families and communities.</p>

        <p><em>Important Note: These calculations assume consistent daily mining (clicking the MINE button every 24 hours). Missed days reduce total earnings proportionally. The system does not accumulate missed mining cycles—if you fail to start a new cycle within the 24-hour window, you lose that day's production.</em></p>

        <div class="info-box important">
            <div class="info-box-title">🎯 Strategic Mining Insights</div>
            <p>Several key insights emerge from analyzing the three-tier mining structure that can inform your long-term strategy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Compounding Value of Upgrades:</strong> Upgrading from Level 1 to Level 2 doubles your daily earnings, while upgrading from Level 2 to Level 3 increases earnings tenfold compared to Level 1. The difference between levels becomes more dramatic over time—a five-year Level 3 miner earns twenty times what a five-year Level 1 miner earns. This creates strong incentive to declare all possible assets and reach higher mining tiers.</li>
                <li><strong>Investment in Asset Declaration:</strong> The time and effort required to document and declare additional assets pays significant dividends through higher mining rates. Even if declaring new assets requires spending money on documentation, valuations, or certifications, the increased mining income typically recoups these costs within months through higher daily production.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-Term Wealth Building:</strong> KABIRU Mining is designed as a long-term wealth-building mechanism rather than a get-rich-quick scheme. Level 3 miners who consistently mine for five years can accumulate over 18 million KSH worth of iKb, representing transformative wealth that can fund major life goals, business investments, or multi-generational asset building.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility at All Levels:</strong> Even Level 1 mining provides meaningful value—182,500 KSH per year represents significant additional income in most African contexts. The system ensures that members at all economic levels can participate and benefit, while still providing proportionally greater rewards to those who contribute more validated value to the ecosystem.</li>

            <p><strong>Important Security Notes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Passwords are case-sensitive—ensure your Caps Lock key is not accidentally engaged</li>
                <li>Check for extra spaces before or after your email address or Member ID</li>
                <li>If copy-pasting credentials, ensure no hidden characters are included</li>
                <li>Never share your password with anyone, including people claiming to be TAU support staff</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">4</span>
            <div class="step-title">Link TAU Member ID (First Time Only)</div>
            <p>On your very first login to KABIRU Mining, the system will detect that your Member ID has not yet been linked to a mining account. You will be prompted to complete a one-time linking process that connects your validated Value Bank from TAU Africa Main App to your KABIRU Mining operations.</p>
            <p>During this linking process, the system performs several critical operations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Verifies that the Member ID you enter matches your authenticated account</li>
                <li>Retrieves your total validated asset value from the TAU Africa database</li>
                <li>Calculates and assigns your appropriate mining level based on your total declared value</li>
                <li>Establishes the data synchronization pathway between TAU Africa and KABIRU Mining</li>
                <li>Creates your KABIRU wallet and initializes your mining dashboard</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why This Linking is Critical:</strong> Without a properly linked Member ID, the KABIRU system has no way to determine your mining capacity. Your mining level is calculated based on your validated assets in TAU Africa, so this connection is absolutely essential. The linking process typically completes within seconds, and you only need to do this once—all subsequent logins will automatically recognize your linked account.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">5</span>
            <div class="step-title">Email Verification (If Required)</div>
            <p>If you registered for KABIRU Mining with an email address that differs from your TAU Africa Main App email, you may be required to verify this email address before mining operations can begin. This security measure prevents unauthorized account creation and ensures that all communication about your mining activities reaches you reliably.</p>
            <p>Check your email inbox for a verification message from TAU Africa. The subject line will typically be "KABIRU Mining - Verify Your Email Address" or similar. Open this email and click the verification link provided. If you don't see the email within five minutes, check your spam or junk mail folder—sometimes automated emails are incorrectly filtered by email providers.</p>
            <p>Once you click the verification link, your browser will open a confirmation page indicating successful email verification. You can then return to the KABIRU Mining Portal and complete your login process. This verification is a one-time requirement that ensures the security and deliverability of all future communications regarding your mining operations, withdrawal notifications, and system updates.</p>

            <div class="info-box-title">⚠️ Common Login Issues and Solutions</div>
            <p>If you encounter difficulties logging into KABIRU Mining, review these common problems and their solutions before contacting support:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wrong Password Error:</strong> Use the "Forgot Password" link to initiate a password reset process. A reset link will be sent to your registered email address. Follow the instructions in that email to create a new password. Remember that passwords are case-sensitive and must match exactly.</li>
                <li><strong>Email Not Verified:</strong> Check your email inbox (and spam/junk folders) for the verification email. Click the verification link. If you cannot find the email, use the "Resend Verification Email" option on the login screen to receive a new verification message.</li>
                <li><strong>No Member ID:</strong> You must first complete the registration process in TAU Africa Main App at https://magero1985.github.io/Tau-Africa/ to receive your Member ID. KABIRU Mining cannot be accessed without a TAU Africa account as your mining capacity depends on validated assets declared in that system.</li>
                <li><strong>No Validated Values:</strong> Your TAU Africa account must contain at least 1,000,000 KSH worth of validated assets before you can begin mining. If you have declared assets but they are still pending validation, you must wait for the validation process to complete (typically three to seven business days). Log back into TAU Africa Main App to check your validation status.</li>
                <li><strong>Browser Compatibility:</strong> KABIRU Mining works best with modern web browsers including Google Chrome (version 80+), Mozilla Firefox (version 75+), Safari (version 13+), or Microsoft Edge (version 80+). If you experience technical issues, try updating your browser to the latest version or switching to a different browser.</li>

        <h2>4. Linking Your TAU Member ID</h2>

        <h3>The Importance of Member ID Linking</h3>
        <p>Your TAU Member ID serves as the critical bridge that connects your validated real-world assets (declared and verified in TAU Africa Main App) with your digital mining operations in KABIRU Mining. This unique identifier, formatted as either TSK-XXXXXX-XXX for TAU-Skill members or TLK-XXXXXX-XXX for TAU-Land members, is not merely a login credential—it is the fundamental mechanism through which the KABIRU system accesses and verifies your mining eligibility.</p>

        <p>The Member ID linking process establishes a secure, authenticated data pathway between the two applications that allows KABIRU Mining to continuously reference your validated asset total, automatically update your mining level when you add new validated assets, synchronize your earning history across the ecosystem, and verify your identity for withdrawal requests and other sensitive operations.</p>

        <p><strong>Without a properly linked Member ID, you CANNOT mine KABIRU currency.</strong> The system has no way to determine your mining capacity, assign your appropriate level, or authorize your daily mining operations. This security measure ensures that only legitimate members with verified assets can participate in the mining ecosystem.</p>

        <h3>Understanding What Linking Accomplishes</h3>
        <p>When you link your TAU Member ID to your KABIRU Mining account, the system performs a series of critical operations that prepare your account for mining operations:</p>

        <h4>1. Asset Value Retrieval</h4>
        <p>The KABIRU system queries the TAU Africa database using your Member ID to retrieve your complete Value Bank information. This includes the total sum of all your validated asset declarations across all categories (physical property, business assets, skills, knowledge). The system calculates this total in real-time to ensure it reflects your most current validated value, accounting for any recent additions or updates you may have made.</p>

        <h4>2. Mining Level Assignment</h4>
        <p>Based on your total validated value, KABIRU automatically assigns you to the appropriate mining level according to these thresholds:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Your Total Validated Value</th>
                <th>Assigned Mining Level</th>
                <th>Daily Mining Rate</th>
                <th>Monthly Potential Earnings</th>
            </tr>

        <p>This assignment happens automatically and instantaneously during the linking process. Your mining level is not fixed—it will automatically upgrade when your total validated value crosses into a higher tier as you declare and validate additional assets over time.</p>

        <h4>3. Wallet Initialization</h4>
        <p>The linking process creates your KABIRU wallet, a secure digital repository where all your mined iKb currency is stored. This wallet is uniquely associated with your Member ID and cannot be accessed by anyone else. The wallet includes multiple features including current balance tracking, transaction history logging, withdrawal request capabilities, and integration with other TAU ecosystem applications for seamless point transfers.</p>

        <h4>4. Dashboard Configuration</h4>
        <p>Your personalized mining dashboard is configured with your specific parameters, including your mining level, daily production rate, total validated asset value, mining history, referral tracking, and current wallet balance. This dashboard serves as your command center for all KABIRU Mining operations.</p>

        <h3>Step-by-Step Linking Process</h3>
        <p>The Member ID linking process is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly, requiring only a few minutes to complete. Follow these detailed instructions for successful linking:</p>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">1</span>
            <div class="step-title">Access Profile Settings or Linking Interface</div>
            <p>After completing your initial login to KABIRU Mining (using your TAU Africa email and password), the system will automatically detect that your Member ID has not yet been linked. You will be presented with a linking interface—this may appear as a popup modal, a dedicated linking page, or within your profile settings section. The interface will be clearly labeled "Link TAU Member ID" or "Connect Your TAU Account" with instructions guiding you through the process.</p>
            <p>If you have already logged in but did not complete the linking process, you can access it manually by clicking on your profile icon or avatar in the top right corner of the screen, selecting "Settings" or "Profile Settings" from the dropdown menu, and navigating to the "Account Linking" or "TAU Member ID" section.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">2</span>
            <div class="step-title">Enter Your Complete Member ID</div>
            <p>Locate your TAU Member ID from your TAU Africa Main App account or from the welcome email you received when you registered. The Member ID follows a specific format that must be entered exactly as shown, including all hyphens and maintaining the correct letter case:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>TAU-Skill Format:</strong> <span class="code">TSK-XXXXXX-XXX</span> where XXXXXX is your unique six-digit member number and XXX is your three-digit verification code</li>
                <li><strong>TAU-Land Format:</strong> <span class="code">TLK-XXXXXX-XXX</span> with the same structure as above but with TLK prefix indicating TAU-Land membership</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Type your complete Member ID carefully into the provided input field. The system may provide real-time format validation, indicating with a green checkmark when the format is correct or a red X when it detects formatting errors. Double-check that you have included the correct prefix (TSK or TLK), all hyphens in the right positions, and all digits entered correctly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">3</span>
            <div class="step-title">Verification and Confirmation</div>
            <p>Once you have entered your Member ID, click the "Link Account" or "Verify Member ID" button. The KABIRU system will immediately begin the verification process, which typically completes within five to fifteen seconds. During this time, the system performs several security and validation checks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Member ID Existence Check:</strong> Verifies that the Member ID you entered actually exists in the TAU Africa database and is associated with an active account</li>
                <li><strong>Email Match Verification:</strong> Confirms that the email address you used to log into KABIRU Mining matches the email address registered with this Member ID in TAU Africa, preventing unauthorized account linking</li>
                <li><strong>Validation Status Check:</strong> Ensures that your TAU Africa account has completed asset declarations with approved validation status (minimum 1,000,000 KSH in validated value)</li>
                <li><strong>Duplicate Prevention:</strong> Checks that this Member ID has not already been linked to a different KABIRU Mining account, maintaining one-to-one account relationships</li>
                <li><strong>Data Synchronization:</strong> If all checks pass, the system pulls your complete validated value information from TAU Africa and calculates your appropriate mining level</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You will see a progress indicator or loading animation during this verification process. Do not close your browser or navigate away from the page until the process completes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">4</span>
            <div class="step-title">Review Confirmation Details</div>
            <p>Upon successful linking, the system will display a comprehensive confirmation screen showing all the details that have been established for your mining account. Review this information carefully to ensure accuracy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linked Member ID:</strong> Displays your complete Member ID that is now permanently associated with this KABIRU Mining account</li>
                <li><strong>Total Validated Value:</strong> Shows the exact total of your validated assets pulled from TAU Africa, displayed in KSH with proper formatting (e.g., "4,500,000 KSH" or "15,750,000 KSH")</li>
                <li><strong>Assigned Mining Level:</strong> Clearly indicates whether you are Level 1 (Basic), Level 2 (Community), or Level 3 (Sovereign) based on your validated value</li>
                <li><strong>Daily Mining Rate:</strong> Specifies exactly how much iKb you will produce each day (0.005 iKb, 0.01 iKb, or 0.1 iKb depending on your level)</li>
                <li><strong>Hourly Accumulation:</strong> Shows your hourly earning rate, calculated by dividing your daily rate by 24 hours, helping you understand how your earnings accumulate throughout each mining cycle</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If any information appears incorrect—for example, if your validated value is lower than expected—return to TAU Africa Main App to verify that all your asset declarations have been properly validated. Contact TAU support if you believe there is an error in the system's calculation or data retrieval.</p>

            <div class="info-box-title">💰 Understanding Your Mining Level Assignment</div>
            <p>Your mining level directly determines your earning potential within KABIRU Mining. Understanding how the system calculates and assigns levels helps you make informed decisions about declaring additional assets to potentially upgrade your mining capacity. Here's a detailed breakdown of the three mining levels with comprehensive examples:</p>
            
            <h4>Level 1 - Basic Miner (1M - 5.99M KSH)</h4>
            <p><strong>Profile Example:</strong> John owns a small plot of land worth 2,500,000 KSH and has professional skills as a teacher valued at 1,500,000 KSH. His total validated value is 4,000,000 KSH, placing him solidly in Level 1.</p>
            <p><strong>Mining Capacity:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Daily Production: 0.005 iKb = 500 KSH per day</li>
                <li>Weekly Production: 0.035 iKb = 3,500 KSH per week</li>
                <li>Monthly Production: ~0.15 iKb = 15,000 KSH per month</li>
                <li>Annual Production: ~1.825 iKb = 182,500 KSH per year</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Level 1 is ideal for new members, those with modest asset portfolios, or individuals primarily relying on skill declarations. While the daily rate may seem small, consistent mining over months and years can accumulate significant value, especially as you declare additional assets to increase your mining level.</p>

            <h4>Level 2 - Community Miner (6M - 11.99M KSH)</h4>
            <p><strong>Profile Example:</strong> Mary owns a residential property worth 5,000,000 KSH, runs a small business valued at 3,000,000 KSH, and has certified professional skills worth 1,500,000 KSH. Her total validated value is 9,500,000 KSH, qualifying her for Level 2.</p>
            <p><strong>Mining Capacity:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Daily Production: 0.01 iKb = 1,000 KSH per day</li>
                <li>Weekly Production: 0.07 iKb = 7,000 KSH per week</li>
                <li>Monthly Production: ~0.30 iKb = 30,000 KSH per month</li>
                <li>Annual Production: ~3.65 iKb = 365,000 KSH per year</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Level 2 represents established members with moderate asset portfolios. This level doubles the mining rate of Level 1, making it a significant upgrade. Many small business owners, property owners, and professionals with multiple income streams operate at this level.</p>

            <h4>Level 3 - Sovereign Miner (12M+ KSH)</h4>
            <p><strong>Profile Example:</strong> David owns commercial property worth 8,000,000 KSH, agricultural land valued at 6,000,000 KSH, operates a medium-sized business worth 4,000,000 KSH, and has specialized professional expertise valued at 2,000,000 KSH. His total validated value is 20,000,000 KSH, placing him in Level 3.</p>
            <p><strong>Mining Capacity:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Daily Production: 0.1 iKb = 10,000 KSH per day</li>
                <li>Weekly Production: 0.7 iKb = 70,000 KSH per week</li>
                <li>Monthly Production: ~3.0 iKb = 300,000 KSH per month</li>
                <li>Annual Production: ~36.5 iKb = 3,650,000 KSH per year</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Level 3 represents high-value members with substantial asset portfolios. This premium level provides ten times the mining rate of Level 1 and five times that of Level 2. Large landowners, established business owners, and professionals with extensive asset portfolios typically operate at this level. The earning potential at Level 3 can represent a significant secondary income stream or even primary income for dedicated miners.</p>

        <h3>How to Upgrade Your Mining Level</h3>
        <p>Your mining level is not permanent—it automatically adjusts based on your total validated value in TAU Africa. To upgrade your mining level and increase your daily production rate, follow this strategic process:</p>

        <div class="info-box tip">
            <div class="info-box-title">📈 Mining Level Upgrade Strategy</div>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identify Additional Assets to Declare:</strong> Review your complete asset portfolio to identify valuable items or capabilities you haven't yet declared in TAU Africa Main App. Consider property you may have inherited, vehicles you own, business assets, equipment, professional certifications you've obtained, or specialized skills you possess. Even if you initially focused on declaring land, remember that TAU Africa values all types of assets including intellectual property, business goodwill, and service capacity.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare Documentation:</strong> Gather supporting documents for these new declarations including title deeds or land certificates for property, business registration documents for enterprises, receipts or valuation reports for vehicles and equipment, professional certificates and licenses for skills, photos and descriptions of business inventory, and any other proof of ownership or capability. Quality documentation speeds up the validation process and increases approval likelihood.</li>
